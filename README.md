# VoidForge

From nothing, everything. A reusable methodology framework for building full-stack applications with Claude Code.

**Drop in a PRD. Get a production application. Forged by a named team of 150+ AI agents across 6 fictional universes.**

---

## What This Is

A git repository containing methodology documents, naming conventions, and orchestration protocols that make Claude Code dramatically more effective at building applications from scratch. Not a code template — a *process* template. Works with any tech stack, any framework, any language.

VoidForge provides:

- **A root context file** (`CLAUDE.md`) — dense operational instructions loaded at session start
- **6 self-contained slash commands** — `/build`, `/qa`, `/security`, `/ux`, `/devops`, `/architect` with inline execution steps
- **A 13-phase build protocol** — PRD to production with conditional skipping, specific verification gates, and rollback strategy
- **A build journal system** — persistent logging so agents recover state across sessions without re-deriving context
- **Context window management** — session scoping, load-on-demand, checkpointing to stay fast
- **6 specialist agent protocols** — each with named lead, themed sub-agents, and behavioral directives
- **An automated testing protocol** — framework-agnostic testing pyramid with authoritative timeline
- **7 code patterns** — API routes, services, components, middleware, error handling, job queues, multi-tenancy — all with framework adaptations (Next.js, Express, Django, Rails)
- **A troubleshooting guide** — error recovery for every build phase including rollback protocol
- **Multi-agent conflict resolution** — tiebreaker protocol for disputes between agents
- **A feedback loop** — `LESSONS.md` for capturing cross-project intelligence
- **Claude Code integration** — settings, hooks, and MCP server guidance
- **150+ named characters** from Tolkien, Marvel, DC Comics, Star Wars, Star Trek, and Anime

## The Team

Six lead agents, each commanding a themed roster of sub-agents.

### Leads

| Agent | Name | Universe | Domain |
|-------|------|----------|--------|
| Frontend & UX | **Galadriel** | Lord of the Rings | UI, UX, accessibility, design systems, responsiveness |
| Backend | **Stark** | Marvel | APIs, databases, services, queues, integrations, error handling |
| QA | **Batman** | DC Comics | Bug hunting, automated testing, hardening, observability |
| Security | **Kenobi** | Star Wars | Auth, injection, secrets, headers, PII, encryption, OWASP |
| Architecture | **Picard** | Star Trek | Schema design, scaling strategy, tech debt, failure modes, ADRs |
| DevOps | **Kusanagi** | Anime | Provisioning, deployment, monitoring, backups, disaster recovery |

### Sub-Agent Highlights

**Tolkien** — Gandalf arrives precisely when things break. Samwise never leaves anyone behind (accessibility). Bilbo writes the microcopy.

**Marvel** — Banner stays calm until queries get slow. Romanoff trusts no external API. Fury oversees performance and tolerates nothing.

**DC Comics** — Oracle sees the whole system. Red Hood breaks everything on purpose. Alfred inspects every dependency personally.

**Star Wars** — Yoda guards authentication with centuries of wisdom. Windu deflects every injection attack. Leia keeps the secrets safe.

**Star Trek** — Spock brings logical precision to data architecture. Scotty knows the infrastructure limits. La Forge keeps the engines running.

**Anime** — Levi deploys with zero wasted motion. Senku builds infrastructure from scratch. L observes everything. Vegeta optimizes relentlessly.

See `docs/NAMING_REGISTRY.md` for the complete roster of 150+ characters.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Clone and go

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USER/voidforge.git my-project
cd my-project
rm -rf .git && git init
```

Replace `docs/PRD.md` with your actual PRD. Open Claude Code and run:

```
/build
```

### Option 2: Use the init script

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USER/voidforge.git
./voidforge/scripts/new-project.sh "My App" ~/my-app
cd ~/my-app
```

### Option 3: Generate a PRD first

1. Open Claude (chat, not Code)
2. Paste the prompt from `docs/methods/PRD_GENERATOR.md`
3. Add your idea (as rough as 1-3 sentences)
4. Save output as `docs/PRD.md`
5. Open Claude Code and run `/build`

## Slash Commands

| Command | Agent | What It Does |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| `/build` | All | Execute the 13-phase build protocol from PRD to production |
| `/qa` | Batman | Full QA pass: static analysis, dynamic probing, automated tests, regression |
| `/security` | Kenobi | OWASP security audit with prioritized findings and remediation |
| `/ux` | Galadriel | Adversarial UX/UI review with accessibility audit |
| `/devops` | Kusanagi | Infrastructure provisioning, deploy scripts, monitoring, backups |
| `/architect` | Picard | Architecture review with ADRs, scaling plan, failure analysis |

---

## How It Works

### The Build Sequence

The `BUILD_PROTOCOL.md` defines a 13-phase sequence with conditional skip rules:

| Phase | Lead Agent | What Happens | Skippable? |
|-------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| 0. Orient | Picard | Reads PRD, extracts architecture, produces ADRs | No |
| 1. Scaffold | Stark + Kusanagi | Framework, configs, schema, test runner | No |
| 2. Infrastructure | Kusanagi | Database, Redis, environment, verify boot | Partial (static sites) |
| 3. Auth | Stark + Galadriel | Login, signup, OAuth, sessions. Kenobi reviews. | Yes (if `auth: no`) |
| 4. Core Feature | Stark + Galadriel | Most important user flow, end-to-end | No |
| 5. Supporting | Stark + Galadriel | Remaining features in dependency order | No |
| 6. Integrations | Stark (Romanoff) | Payments, email, storage, external APIs | Partial (per feature flag) |
| 7. Admin | Stark + Galadriel | Admin panel, dashboards, audit logging | Yes (if `admin: no`) |
| 8. Marketing | Galadriel | Homepage, pricing, legal, SEO | Yes (if `marketing: no`) |
| 9. QA Pass | Batman | Oracle + Red Hood + Nightwing (tests) + Alfred + Lucius | No |
| 10. UX/UI Pass | Galadriel | Full adversarial UX/UI + a11y review | Yes (if API-only) |
| 11. Security Pass | Kenobi | Full OWASP audit | No |
| 12. Deploy | Kusanagi | Provision, deploy, monitor, backup | No |
| 13. Launch | All | Full checklist verified | No |

### PRD Frontmatter

The PRD includes a YAML frontmatter block that tells the build protocol which features exist:

```yaml
auth: yes
payments: stripe
workers: no
admin: yes
marketing: no
deploy: vps
```

The build protocol reads these values and automatically skips irrelevant phases.

### Build Journal

Every agent produces persistent log files in `/logs/`. When context compresses or a new session starts, agents read journal files to recover state. See `BUILD_JOURNAL.md`.

- `build-state.md` — master state file, read at every session start (under 50 lines)
- `phase-XX-*.md` — per-phase logs with decisions, test results, findings
- `decisions.md` — running log of all non-obvious decisions
- `handoffs.md` — every agent-to-agent handoff with context

### Context Management

`CONTEXT_MANAGEMENT.md` keeps sessions fast:

- Load method docs on demand, not all upfront
- One phase or agent domain per session
- Checkpoint to `/logs/build-state.md` before context fills
- New sessions pick up from the journal, not from scratch

### Code Patterns

7 reference implementations in `docs/patterns/`, all with framework adaptations:

- **api-route.ts** — Zod validation, auth check, service call (+ Express/Django/Rails notes)
- **service.ts** — Business logic, ownership checks, typed errors (+ Django/Rails notes)
- **component.tsx** — Loading/empty/error/success states, keyboard accessible (+ Vue/Svelte notes)
- **middleware.ts** — Auth middleware, request logging, rate limiting (+ Express/Django/Rails notes)
- **error-handling.ts** — Canonical error strategy: types, handler, response shape (all frameworks)
- **job-queue.ts** — Background jobs: idempotency, retry, DLQ (BullMQ + Celery + Sidekiq)
- **multi-tenant.ts** — Workspace scoping, tenant isolation, RBAC (Next.js + Django + Rails)

### Testing

Testing protocol with framework-agnostic principles and a framework-to-test-runner mapping:

- Unit tests for business logic (vitest/jest/pytest/RSpec)
- Integration tests for API routes
- Tests are a **breaking gate** — failing tests prevent phase advancement
- Authoritative timeline: which tests are written in which phase

### Troubleshooting

Error recovery for every build phase including a **rollback protocol** — identify, revert, verify, isolate, fix, re-apply, log.

### Agent Cross-References

Every agent knows when to hand off:

- Galadriel finds bad API data → **Stark**
- Stark finds a vulnerability → **Kenobi**
- Batman finds an architecture problem → **Picard**
- Kenobi's fix needs infra changes → **Kusanagi**

## Evolving VoidForge

VoidForge gets smarter over time:

1. **After each project:** Add entries to `docs/LESSONS.md`
2. **When a pattern proves reliable:** Promote it from LESSONS.md into the relevant method doc
3. **When you discover a new process:** Add a method doc to `docs/methods/`
4. **When you write reusable code:** Add a pattern to `docs/patterns/`

---

## Philosophy

**Methodology, not templates.** Stack-agnostic process that works for Next.js, Django, Rails, or anything else.

**Accumulate intelligence.** Every project makes VoidForge better through `LESSONS.md` and promoted patterns.

**Named agents are not gimmicks.** They create scope boundaries, make logs scannable, and make development more fun.

**The PRD is sacred.** Agents never override product decisions with process opinions.

**Verify everything.** Manual verification, automated tests, and regression checklists. All three.

**Skip what doesn't apply.** Not every project needs all 13 phases.

**Log everything.** The build journal is your persistent memory across sessions. Decisions, test results, handoffs, failures — all on disk, all recoverable.

**Stay fast.** Context management keeps sessions lean. Load on demand, checkpoint often, start fresh when needed.
