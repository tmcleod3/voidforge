# VoidForge Core

The ultra-light tier. All methodology, no infrastructure. Drop into any project.

**What's inside:** 150+ named agents across 6 fictional universes, all 16 agent protocols, 10 slash commands, 7 code patterns, the full 13-phase build protocol, and the Holocron.

## Usage

### Drop into an existing project

```bash
git clone --branch core https://github.com/tmcleod3/voidforge.git /tmp/vf
cp -r /tmp/vf/.claude /tmp/vf/CLAUDE.md /tmp/vf/HOLOCRON.md /tmp/vf/docs your-project/
```

Then open your project with Claude Code and run `/build`.

### Reference as context

Point Claude Code at the cloned core branch directly. The `CLAUDE.md` and slash commands will be picked up automatically.

## What's NOT here

No wizard, no deploy scripts, no npm dependencies. Just the methodology.

- Want the interactive wizard and cloud provisioners? Use the [`main`](https://github.com/tmcleod3/voidforge/tree/main) branch.
- Want methodology plus shell scripts but no wizard? Use the [`scaffold`](https://github.com/tmcleod3/voidforge/tree/scaffold) branch.
