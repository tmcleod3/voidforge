# CLAUDE.md

## Project

- **Name:** [PROJECT_NAME]
- **One-liner:** [ONE_LINE_DESCRIPTION]
- **Domain:** [DOMAIN]
- **Repo:** [REPO_URL]

## Coding Standards

- **TypeScript strict mode.** No `any` unless unavoidable and commented.
- **Small, focused files.** One component per file. Max ~300 lines per source file.
- **Validate at boundaries.** Zod schemas on all API inputs. Never trust client data.
- **Error handling:** Use `ApiError` types per `/docs/patterns/error-handling.ts`. Never leak internals.
- **Logging:** Structured JSON. Include requestId, userId, action. Never log PII.
- **Business logic in services, not routes.** Routes: validate -> service -> format response.
- **Ownership checks on every user-scoped query.** No IDOR. Return 404, not 403.
- **No new dependencies** without explicit justification.
- **Accessibility is not optional.** Keyboard nav, focus management, contrast, ARIA.
- **Small batches.** One flow per batch, max ~200 lines changed. Verify after each.
- **Commits:** Small, explainable in one sentence.

## Build Journal — Log Everything

Every phase, decision, handoff, and failure gets logged to `/logs/`. See `/docs/methods/BUILD_JOURNAL.md`.

- **Start of session:** Read `/logs/build-state.md` to recover state
- **During work:** Log decisions, test results, and findings to the active phase log
- **End of session or context getting heavy:** Update `/logs/build-state.md` with current state

## Context Management

Pre-load active domain methodology. Load application code on demand. See `/docs/methods/CONTEXT_MANAGEMENT.md`.

- Pre-load method docs for the active agent's domain at session start (1M context budget allows this)
- Watch for context pressure symptoms (re-reading files, forgetting decisions). When noticed, ask user to run `/context`. Only checkpoint when actual usage exceeds 70%.
- Per-directory `CLAUDE.md` files for directory-specific conventions (keep under 50 lines each)

## Code Patterns

Reference implementations in `/docs/patterns/`. Match these shapes when writing. All patterns include framework adaptations (Next.js, Express, Django, Rails).

- `api-route.ts` — Validation, auth, service call, consistent response
- `service.ts` — Business logic, ownership checks, typed errors
- `component.tsx` — Loading, empty, error, success states. Keyboard accessible.
- `middleware.ts` — Auth, request logging, rate limiting
- `error-handling.ts` — Canonical error strategy (single source of truth)
- `job-queue.ts` — Background jobs: idempotency, retry, dead letter queue
- `multi-tenant.ts` — Workspace scoping, tenant isolation, role-based access

## Release Tiers

VoidForge ships on three branches. Shared methodology files exist on all three.

| Branch | What's Included | Use Case |
|--------|----------------|----------|
| `main` | Full — wizards, provisioners, AWS SDK, everything | `npx voidforge init` / `npx voidforge deploy` |
| `scaffold` | Methodology only — CLAUDE.md, commands, methods, patterns, Holocron | `git clone --branch scaffold`, add PRD, `/build` |
| `core` | Ultra-light — CLAUDE.md, commands, methods, patterns, naming registry | Point Claude Code at branch to absorb methodology |

**Branch sync rule:** Changes to any shared file must propagate to all branches. Shared files:
- `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/commands/*`
- `docs/methods/*`, `docs/patterns/*`, `docs/NAMING_REGISTRY.md`
- `HOLOCRON.md`, `VERSION.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`

**NOT shared** (main-only): `package.json` (wizard dependencies differ per tier), `package-lock.json`, `.claude/settings.json` (user permissions/hooks), `wizard/*`, `scripts/*`, `logs/*`, `.env`

Scaffold and core have their own minimal `package.json` (name + version + description only — no dependencies). When syncing version bumps, update `VERSION.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` on all branches but leave each branch's `package.json` version field to be updated independently.

The agents, characters, and personality are VoidForge's identity — never strip them from any tier.

## How to Build

Read the PRD. Run `/build`. Or see `/docs/methods/BUILD_PROTOCOL.md`.
