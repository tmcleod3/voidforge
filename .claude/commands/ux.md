# /ux — Galadriel's UX/UI Pass

**AGENT DEPLOYMENT IS MANDATORY.** Step 2 specifies parallel agent launches via the Agent tool. You MUST launch Elrond, Arwen, Samwise, and Celeborn as separate sub-processes. Do NOT shortcut to inline analysis. (Field report #68)

## Dynamic Dispatch (ADR-044)

Opus scans `git diff --stat` and matches changed files against the `description` fields of all 264 agents in `.claude/agents/`. Matching specialists launch alongside the core agents below.

**Dispatch control:** `--light` skips dynamic dispatch (core only). `--solo` runs lead agent only.

## Silver Surfer Pre-Scan (ADR-048)

Before agent deployment, the Silver Surfer selects the optimal roster:

Run: `npx thevoidforge herald --command /ux --json`
(Add `--focus "<topic>"` if the user provided `--focus`)

Parse the JSON output. The `roster` array contains agent IDs to deploy alongside this command's lead agents. If the command fails or returns an empty roster, use the hardcoded manifest below.

**`--focus "topic"`** biases the Surfer toward agents matching the topic.
**`--light`** skips the Surfer — uses only hardcoded core roster.
**`--solo`** skips Surfer and all sub-agents — lead only.

## Context Setup
1. Read `/logs/build-state.md` — understand current project state
2. Read `/docs/methods/PRODUCT_DESIGN_FRONTEND.md`
3. Read `/docs/LESSONS.md` — check for UX-relevant lessons (a11y gaps, component gotchas, CSS issues). Flag matches during review.

## Step 0 — Orient
Detect: framework, styling system, component library, routing, state management.
Document in phase log: "How to run", key routes, where components/styles/copy live.

**Screenshot mandate (MANDATORY):** If the app is runnable, start the server, take screenshots of EVERY page via Playwright or browser, and READ them via the Read tool. Without screenshots, the review is code-reading — not visual verification. Take at desktop (1440x900), plus 375px and 768px for responsive proof-of-life.

## Step 1 — Product Surface Map
List every screen/route, primary user journeys, key shared components, and the state taxonomy (loading/empty/error/success/partial/unauthorized). Write to phase log.

## Step 1.75 — Enchantment Review
Before the auditors begin, **Eowyn** `subagent_type: Eowyn` dreams. Read the PRD's brand personality section. Walk through each primary flow and ask:
- Where could this surprise and delight?
- Where does functionality need warmth?
- Do transitions breathe or just appear? (200ms ease-out minimum for panels, modals, state changes)
- Do empty states invite or repel? (illustrations, warm copy, calls to action)
- Does loading feel like anticipation or waiting? (progressive reveals, warm shimmers)
- Do micro-moments celebrate? (toast personality, pin bounces, checkmark draws)
- Is there a consistent motion language? (same duration/easing vocabulary throughout)
- Does the first 5 seconds feel like the brand?
- Could each opportunity be implemented in ~5 lines? (magic must be lightweight)

Log enchantment opportunities to phase log with effort estimates. These are **nice-to-have** — never block ship. But the best ones get implemented in Step 6.

See `PRODUCT_DESIGN_FRONTEND.md` Step 1.75 for full Éowyn protocol.

## Step 2 — Parallel Analysis
Use the Agent tool to run these simultaneously — all are read-only analysis:
- **Agent 1** `subagent_type: Elrond` — UX: information architecture, navigation, task flows, friction points, discoverability, flow intuitiveness.
- **Agent 2** `subagent_type: Arwen` — Visual: spacing, typography, color usage, button hierarchy, visual consistency.
- **Agent 3** `subagent_type: Samwise` — A11y: keyboard navigation, focus management, ARIA labels, color contrast, reduced motion. Keyboard-only testing.
- **Agent 4** `subagent_type: Celeborn` — Design system: spacing token consistency, typography scale, palette adherence, component naming conventions.

**Aragorn** `subagent_type: Aragorn` orchestrates when multiple findings conflict — prioritizes which matter most for users.

Synthesize findings from all agents.

## Step 3 — Sequential Reviews
These require interactive testing:

- **Bilbo** `subagent_type: Bilbo` — Copy: all microcopy (labels, buttons, error messages, empty states, confirmations, destructive warnings). Clear and consistent?
- **Pippin** `subagent_type: Pippin` — Edge cases: resize to 320px, paste emoji in search, click back mid-flow, two tabs, light/dark toggle mid-animation.
- **Frodo** `subagent_type: Frodo` — (conditional) Hardest flow: dedicated attention on the single most critical + complex flow. Skip if no single flow dominates.
- **Legolas** `subagent_type: Legolas` — Code: component architecture, semantic HTML, CSS organization, state management. Reference `/docs/patterns/component.tsx`.
- **Gimli** `subagent_type: Gimli` — Performance: loading states, skeleton screens, layout shift, optimistic UI, mobile responsiveness, touch targets (min 44px).
- **Radagast** `subagent_type: Radagast` — Edge cases + error states: empty/huge/unicode inputs, broken states, dangerous actions without confirmation, validation gaps.

**ERROR STATE TESTING (mandatory):** For every form/action in the UI:
- Submit with intentionally invalid data (duplicate name, wrong format, missing required field)
- Verify the error message is SPECIFIC and ACTIONABLE — never generic ("something went wrong", "failed to save")
- Verify the form state after error allows retry without losing user input
- If the feature involves a resource that can conflict (duplicate slug, duplicate email, taken domain), test the conflict case explicitly
- For every API error the backend can return, verify the UI displays it meaningfully

## Step 4 — Issue Tracker
Log all findings to `/logs/phase-10-ux-audit.md`:

| ID | Title | Severity | Confidence | Category | Location | Current | Expected | Fix | Status |
|----|-------|----------|------------|----------|----------|---------|----------|-----|--------|

Categories: UX, Visual, A11y, Copy, Performance, Edge Case

**Confidence scoring is mandatory.** Every finding includes a confidence score (0-100). If confidence is below 60, escalate to a second agent from a different universe (e.g., if Samwise found it, escalate to Padmé or Nightwing) to verify before including. If the second agent disagrees, drop the finding. High-confidence findings (90+) skip re-verification in Step 7.5.

## Step 5 — Enhancement Specs (before coding)
For each fix: problem statement, proposed solution, acceptance criteria, a11y requirements (**Samwise** `subagent_type: Samwise` signs off), copy (**Bilbo** `subagent_type: Bilbo` signs off). **Faramir** `subagent_type: Faramir` checks whether polish effort targets the right screens — high-traffic core flows, not low-traffic edge pages.

## Step 6 — Implement (small batches)
One batch = one flow or component cluster (max ~200 lines changed). **Boromir** `subagent_type: Boromir` checks: is the polish overengineered? Too many animations? Does complexity hurt performance? **Glorfindel** `subagent_type: Glorfindel` handles the hardest rendering (canvas, WebGL, SVG -- conditional, only if the project has visual complexity). After each batch:
1. Re-run the app
2. Re-walk the affected flow
3. Test keyboard navigation
4. Update issue tracker status
5. Run `npm test` to catch regressions

## Step 7 — Harden Design System
**Arwen** `subagent_type: Arwen` leads. **Haldir** `subagent_type: Haldir` checks transitions between pages, states, and components — loading->success, error->retry, navigate->return. Are they smooth or jarring? Audit shared components (buttons, inputs, cards, modals, toasts) for:
- Consistent variants (primary, secondary, danger, ghost)
- Responsive behavior
- Keyboard focus styles
- Proper ARIA attributes

## Step 7.5 — Pass 2: Re-Verify Fixes
After all fixes are applied, run a verification pass:
- **Samwise** `subagent_type: Samwise` re-audits accessibility on all modified components — verify a11y fixes didn't break other a11y properties
- **Radagast** `subagent_type: Radagast` re-checks edge cases on fixed flows — verify fixes hold under adversarial input
- **Merry** `subagent_type: Merry` pair-verifies Pippin's edge case resolutions — one found it, the other confirms the fix

If Pass 2 finds new issues, fix and re-verify until Samwise, Radagast, and Merry sign off.

## Step 8 — Regression Checklist
Add UX-specific items to the regression checklist in `/docs/qa-prompt.md`:

| # | Flow | A11y Check | Responsive Check | Status |
|---|------|-----------|-----------------|--------|

## Step 9 — Deliverables
1. UX_UI_AUDIT.md — all findings
2. Updated regression checklist in qa-prompt.md
3. Code fixes
4. "Next improvements" backlog in phase log
