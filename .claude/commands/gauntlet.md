# /gauntlet — Thanos's Comprehensive Review

*"I am inevitable."*

The Gauntlet tests everything. Every domain. Multiple rounds. Escalating intensity. The project either survives or it doesn't. This is NOT a build command — it assumes code is already written. Run it after `/build` or `/campaign` to put the finished product through absolute hell.

## Context Setup
1. Read `/docs/methods/GAUNTLET.md` for operating rules
2. Read `/logs/build-state.md` — what was built, what phases completed
3. Read `/docs/PRD.md` — the source of truth for what the project should be

## Dynamic Dispatch (ADR-044)

Opus scans `git diff --stat` and matches changed files against the `description` fields of all 264 agents in `.claude/agents/`. Matching specialists launch alongside the core agents below.

**Dispatch control:** `--light` skips dynamic dispatch (core only). `--solo` runs lead agent only.

## Silver Surfer Pre-Scan (ADR-048)

Before agent deployment, the Silver Surfer selects the optimal roster:

Run: `npx thevoidforge herald --command /gauntlet --json`
(Add `--focus "<topic>"` if the user provided `--focus`)

Parse the JSON output. The `roster` array contains agent IDs to deploy alongside this command's lead agents. If the command fails or returns an empty roster, use the hardcoded manifest below.

**`--focus "topic"`** biases the Surfer toward agents matching the topic.
**`--light`** skips the Surfer — uses only hardcoded core roster.
**`--solo`** skips Surfer and all sub-agents — lead only.

## Round 1 — Discovery (parallel)

**Thanos:** "Before I test, I must understand."

Use the Agent tool to run all five in parallel — these are read-only analysis:

- **Agent 1** `subagent_type: Picard` — Schema review, service boundaries, dependency graph, scaling assessment. Read the full `/architect` protocol but produce findings only (no ADRs — this is review, not design).
- **Agent 2** `subagent_type: Stark` — Pattern compliance, logic errors, type safety, cross-module data flow tracing. Read `/review` protocol. One pass across all source files.
- **Agent 3** `subagent_type: Galadriel` — Product surface map, usability walkthrough (Step 1.5), Éowyn's enchantment scan (Step 1.75). No fixes yet — discovery only.
- **Agent 4** `subagent_type: Kenobi` — List all endpoints, WebSocket handlers, file I/O, credential access points, user input parsing. Classify each by risk tier. No deep audit yet — just the map.
- **Agent 5** `subagent_type: Kusanagi` — Scan deploy scripts, generated configs, provisioning scripts, CI/CD templates. Classify each by risk: hardcoded credentials, open ports, missing auth on generated services. No deep audit yet — just the map.

Synthesize all five into a unified findings list. Log to `/logs/gauntlet-round-1.md`.

## Round 2 — First Strike (parallel)

**Thanos:** "Now I test every stone."

Use the Agent tool to run all four in parallel — full domain audits:

- **Agent 1** `subagent_type: Batman` — Run the complete `/qa` protocol. Oracle + Red Hood + Alfred + Deathstroke + Constantine + Nightwing + Lucius. Every edge case, every error state, every boundary.
- **Agent 2** `subagent_type: Galadriel` — Run the complete `/ux` protocol. Elrond + Arwen + Samwise + Bilbo + Legolas + Gimli + Radagast + Éowyn. Usability, visual, a11y, copy, performance, edge cases, enchantment.
- **Agent 3** `subagent_type: Kenobi` — Run the complete `/security` protocol. Leia + Chewie + Rex + Maul parallel scans, then Yoda → Windu → Ahsoka → Padmé sequential audits.
- **Agent 4** `subagent_type: Stark` — For every API endpoint, trace the full data path: client request → validation → service → database → response. For every file upload, trace: upload → storage → retrieval → display. For every credential, trace: entry → vault → usage → cleanup.

Merge all findings. Deduplicate across domains.

**→ FIX BATCH 1:** Fix all Critical and High findings. Update finding status. **Build-output gate:** If the project has a build step, run the build after fixes and verify output — framework-generated inline scripts, hydration markers, and SSR output are invisible to source-level analysis but can be broken by security hardening (especially CSP changes). Check: `npm run build && grep -c '<script>' dist/**/*.html`.

## Round 2.5 — Runtime Smoke Test (Hawkeye)

If the project has a runnable server, start it and verify the full lifecycle:
1. Start the server (`npm run dev`, `python manage.py runserver`, etc.)
2. Hit every new/modified API endpoint with curl — verify HTTP status codes
3. If WebSocket endpoints exist, open a connection and verify handshake + data flow
4. If terminal/PTY features exist, create a session and verify it stays alive for 5 seconds
5. If the server cannot start (scaffold/methodology-only), skip with a note

This catches runtime bugs invisible to static analysis: IPv6 binding, native module ABI, WebSocket framing, browser caching.

## Round 3 — Second Strike (parallel)

**Thanos:** "The first wave reveals. The second wave breaks."

Use the Agent tool to run all four in parallel — targeted re-verification:

- **Agent 1** `subagent_type: Batman` — Nightwing re-runs the test suite. Red Hood re-probes fixed areas. Deathstroke tests new boundaries created by the fixes. Focus on regressions.
- **Agent 2** `subagent_type: Galadriel` — Samwise re-audits a11y on all modified components. Radagast re-checks edge cases on fixed flows. Bilbo re-checks microcopy on any changed UI.
- **Agent 3** `subagent_type: Kenobi` — Maul re-probes all remediated vulnerabilities. Ahsoka verifies access control across every role boundary. Padmé verifies the primary user flow still works (critical path smoke test).
- **Agent 4** `subagent_type: Kusanagi` — Run the complete `/devops` protocol with full team: Senku (provisioning), Levi (deploy), Spike (networking), L (monitoring), Bulma (backup), Holo (cost), Valkyrie (disaster recovery). Deploy scripts, monitoring, backups, health checks, page weight gate, security headers.

**→ FIX BATCH 2:** Fix remaining findings.

## Round 4 — The Crossfire (parallel — adversarial)

**Thanos:** "Now the real test. Everyone attacks everyone else's work."

Use the Agent tool to run all five in parallel — pure adversarial:

- `subagent_type: Maul` — Attacks code that passed /review. Looks for exploits in "clean" code.
- `subagent_type: Deathstroke` — Probes endpoints that /security hardened. Tests if remediations can be bypassed.
- `subagent_type: Loki` — Chaos-tests features that /qa cleared. What breaks under unexpected conditions?
- `subagent_type: Constantine` — Hunts cursed code in FIXED areas specifically. Code that only works by accident.
- `subagent_type: Eowyn` — Final enchantment pass on the polished, hardened product. Where can delight still be added without compromising security or stability?

**→ FIX BATCH 3:** Fix all adversarial findings. If any fix is applied, re-run the affected adversarial agent on the fixed area only.

## Round 5 — The Council (parallel — convergence)

**Thanos:** "One last look. Every domain. One voice."

Use the Agent tool to run all six in parallel:

- `subagent_type: Spock` — Did any QA/security/UX fix break code patterns or quality?
- `subagent_type: Ahsoka` — Did any fix introduce access control gaps?
- `subagent_type: Nightwing` — Full regression: run the entire test suite. Any failures?
- `subagent_type: Samwise` — Final accessibility audit on all modified components.
- `subagent_type: Padme` — Critical path functional verification. Open the app, complete the main task, verify output.
- `subagent_type: Troi` — PRD compliance: read the PRD prose section-by-section, verify every claim against the implementation. Numeric claims, visual treatments, copy accuracy.

If the Council finds issues:
1. Fix code discrepancies. Flag asset requirements as BLOCKED.
2. Re-run the Council (max 2 iterations).
3. If not converged after 2 rounds, present remaining findings to the user.

## The Snap — Thanos's Verdict

**If all domains sign off:**
> *"I am inevitable. The project survives the Gauntlet."*

Present the final summary:
- Total findings across all 5 rounds
- Total fixes applied
- Findings by domain (QA, UX, Security, Architecture, DevOps)
- Test suite status
- Outstanding items (if any)

**Wong extracts lessons:** Append notable patterns to `/docs/LESSONS.md`.

**If findings remain:**
Present them with severity and recommendation. The user decides whether to ship or iterate.

## Arguments (ADR-043: Max by Default)

Default is now maximum intensity (was `--infinity`). Flags opt out.

- No arguments → 10-round Infinity Gauntlet with full roster (~60-80 agent launches). **ENFORCEMENT: Must launch Agent tool sub-processes. Inline analysis is not a Gauntlet.**
- `--fast` → 3 rounds only (skip Round 4 Crossfire + Round 5 Council). (formerly `--quick` — renamed v17.3 for cross-command consistency)
- `--light` → 5-round standard gauntlet with core agents only (pre-ADR-043 default behavior)
- `--security-only` → 4 rounds of security only (Kenobi marathon)
- `--ux-only` → 4 rounds of UX only (Galadriel marathon)
- `--qa-only` → 4 rounds of QA only (Batman marathon)
- `--focus "topic"` → Bias Herald toward topic (natural-language, additive)
- `--resume` → resume from last completed round (reads gauntlet state from logs)
- `--ux-extra` → Extra Éowyn enchantment emphasis across all rounds. Galadriel's team proposes micro-animations, copy improvements, and delight moments beyond standard usability/a11y.
- `--assess` → **Pre-build assessment.** Rounds 1-2 only (Discovery + First Strike), no fix batches. Produces assessment report grouped by root cause.
- `--solo` → Lead agent per domain only, no sub-agents (quick spot-check).
- `--infinity` → **Retired (no-op).** Default is now maximum intensity.
- `--muster` → **Retired (no-op).** Default is now full roster.

## Operating Rules
- Update `/logs/gauntlet-state.md` after EVERY round
- The Gauntlet does NOT build code — it reviews and hardens existing code
- Fixes happen BETWEEN rounds, not batched at the end
- **Confidence scoring is mandatory.** Every finding must include: ID, severity, confidence score (0-100), file, description, fix recommendation. Format: `[ID] [SEVERITY] [CONFIDENCE: XX] [FILE] [DESCRIPTION]`. See GAUNTLET.md "Agent Confidence Scoring" for ranges.
- **Low-confidence escalation:** Findings below 60 confidence MUST be escalated to a second agent from a different universe before inclusion. If the second agent disagrees, drop the finding. If the second agent agrees, upgrade to medium confidence.
- **High-confidence fast-track:** Findings at 90+ confidence skip re-verification in Pass 2.
- If context pressure symptoms appear, ask user to run `/context`. Only checkpoint at >70%. NEVER reduce Gauntlet rounds, skip agents, or "run efficiently" based on self-assessed context pressure. See CAMPAIGN.md "Quality Reduction Anti-Pattern" — this is a hard rule.
- The Gauntlet is the final test before shipping. Treat it with appropriate gravity.

## Handoffs
- If architecture changes are needed → log for Picard
- If new tests are needed → log for Batman (`/test`)
- If deploy config changes are needed → log for Kusanagi (`/devops`)
- At completion, offer Bashir (`/debrief`) to capture session learnings
