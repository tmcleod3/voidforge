# /architect — Picard's Architecture Review

**AGENT DEPLOYMENT IS MANDATORY.** Steps 1 and 4 specify parallel agent launches via the Agent tool. You MUST actually launch these agents as separate sub-processes — do NOT shortcut to inline analysis, even if you think you can answer faster by reading files directly. The agents exist because parallel analysis catches things sequential reading misses. Skipping agent deployment is a protocol violation. (Field report #68)

## Dynamic Dispatch (ADR-044)

Opus scans `git diff --stat` and matches changed files against the `description` fields of all 263 agents in `.claude/agents/`. Matching specialists launch alongside the core agents below.

**Dispatch control:** `--light` skips dynamic dispatch (core only). `--solo` runs lead agent only.

**Promoted agent:** **Riker** `subagent_type: Riker` runs on every ADR written — challenges trade-offs.

## Herald Pre-Scan (ADR-047)

Before agent deployment, run the Herald to select the optimal roster:

1. Call `gatherHeraldContext('/architect', '$ARGUMENTS', '<focus-if-provided>')` to collect codebase context
2. Call `loadAgentRegistry()` to get all 263 agent definitions
3. Call `runHerald(context, registry)` to get the optimal roster
4. Merge Herald's roster with this command's hardcoded lead agents (Herald adds, never removes leads)
5. Deploy the merged roster per the command's normal parallel/sequential protocol

**`--focus "topic"`** biases the Herald toward agents matching the topic. Examples: `--focus "security"`, `--focus "financial accuracy"`, `--focus "mobile UX"`.

**`--light`** skips the Herald entirely — uses only the command's hardcoded core roster.
**`--solo`** skips both Herald and all sub-agents — lead agent only.

## Context Setup
1. Read `/logs/build-state.md` — understand current project state
2. Read `/docs/methods/SYSTEMS_ARCHITECT.md`
3. Read `/docs/PRD.md` (System Architecture + Tech Stack sections)

## Pre-Analysis — Conflict Scan
Before any deep analysis, scan the PRD frontmatter for structural contradictions (see SYSTEMS_ARCHITECT.md Conflict Checklist). Check: auth+database, payments+auth, websockets+deploy, workers+deploy, database+deploy, cache+deploy, admin+auth, email+credentials. Flag any contradictions immediately — these cost hours if caught late.

## Agent Deployment Manifest

**Lead:** `subagent_type: Picard`
**Full bridge crew:** `spock-schema`, `uhura-integration`, `worf-security-arch`, `tuvok-deep-current`, `scotty-infrastructure`, `kim-api-design`, `janeway-novel-arch`, `torres-site-scanner`, `la-forge-reliability`, `data-tech-debt`, `crusher-diagnostics`, `archer-greenfield`, `pike-bold-decisions`, `riker-review`, `troi-prd-compliance`

## Step 0 — System Discovery
- **Crusher** `subagent_type: Crusher` — System health baseline: test coverage, build time, dependency age, code complexity.
- **Archer** `subagent_type: Archer` — (greenfield only) Initial directory structure, module boundaries, naming conventions.

Produce: system identity, component inventory, data flow diagram (ASCII), dependency graph.
Write to `/logs/` (phase-00 if during orient, or a dedicated architecture log).

## Step 1 — Parallel Analysis
Use the Agent tool to run these in parallel — they are independent analysis tasks:

- **Agent 1** `subagent_type: Spock` — Schema review: normalization, index/query alignment, nullable fields, audit fields, PII isolation, data lifecycle, backup/recovery.
- **Agent 2** `subagent_type: Uhura` — Integration review: service inventory (purpose, failure mode, fallback, cost, lock-in), API version pinning, response validation, abstraction layers.
- **Agent 3** `subagent_type: Worf` — Security implications of architectural decisions: PII colocation, unauthenticated internal state access, permissive service boundaries. Audits *design*, not code.
- **Agent 4** `subagent_type: Tuvok` — Security architecture: auth flow design, token storage, session architecture, encryption at rest vs in transit. Where Worf flags implications, Tuvok designs solutions.

Synthesize findings from all four agents.

## Step 2 — Service Architecture + API Design
- **Scotty** `subagent_type: Scotty` — Boundary assessment, monolith vs services, async vs sync decisions.
- **Kim** `subagent_type: Kim` — API surface review: REST conventions, error shapes, pagination, versioning.
- **Janeway** `subagent_type: Janeway` — (conditional) When standard monolith doesn't fit: event-sourcing, CQRS, serverless, edge computing.
- Informed by Spock's schema, Uhura's integrations, and Worf/Tuvok's security findings.

## Step 3 — Scaling + Performance
- **Scotty** `subagent_type: Scotty` — First bottleneck identification, three-tier scaling plan (current → 10x vertical → 100x horizontal), cost estimates.
- **Torres** `subagent_type: Torres` — Performance architecture: N+1 patterns, missing indexes, connection pool sizing, caching strategy gaps.

## Step 4 — Parallel Analysis
Use the Agent tool to run these in parallel — they are independent analysis tasks:

- **Agent 1** `subagent_type: La Forge` — Failure analysis: for each component, answer "What happens when this fails?" (DB down, cache down, API down, worker crash).
- **Agent 2** `subagent_type: Data` — Tech debt catalog: wrong/missing abstraction, premature optimization, deferred decisions, dependency debt, documentation debt. Severity table with impact/risk/effort/urgency.

## Step 5 — ADRs + Decision Review
Write Architecture Decision Records to `/docs/adrs/` for every non-obvious choice. After writing, **Riker** `subagent_type: Riker` reviews: challenges trade-offs, verifies alternatives were truly considered, checks for second-order effects.
```
# ADR-001: [Title]
## Status: Accepted
## Context: [Why this decision was needed]
## Decision: [What was decided]
## Consequences: [Trade-offs, what this enables, what this prevents]
## Alternatives: [What else was considered and why it was rejected]
```

## Conflict Resolution
When architectural decisions conflict with other agents:
1. Check the PRD — product requirements take precedence
2. If PRD is silent, present trade-offs to the user with a recommendation
3. Document the resolution as an ADR
4. Log to `/logs/decisions.md`

For specific conflicts:
- **Picard vs Kusanagi (infra can't support arch):** Picard adjusts architecture to match real constraints
- **Picard vs Stark (implementation disagrees with design):** Present options, Picard decides, document as ADR
- **Picard vs Kenobi (security vs simplicity):** Security wins. Find the simplest secure architecture.

## Deliverables
1. ARCHITECTURE.md
2. /docs/adrs/ directory with decision records
3. SCALING.md
4. TECH_DEBT.md
5. FAILURE_MODES.md
6. All findings logged to appropriate `/logs/` file

## Arguments
- `--plan [description]` → Planning mode: analyze and recommend without executing. Present findings and proposed changes for review.
- `--focus "topic"` → Bias Herald toward topic (natural-language, additive)
- `--muster` → *(retired — accepted as no-op per ADR-043. Full roster is now the default. Use `--light` to reduce.)*

## Handoffs
- API/DB implementation → Stark, log to `/logs/handoffs.md`
- UI impacts → Galadriel, log to `/logs/handoffs.md`
- Security implications → Kenobi, log to `/logs/handoffs.md`
- Infrastructure constraints → Kusanagi, log to `/logs/handoffs.md`
