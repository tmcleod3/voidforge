---

## [2.1.1] - 2026-03-12

### Fixed
- **PostToolUse hook format** in `.claude/settings.json` — migrated from flat `command` field to nested `hooks` array structure per current Claude Code schema

---

## [2.1.0] - 2026-03-10

### Added
- **Build Journal system** (`docs/methods/BUILD_JOURNAL.md`) — persistent logging protocol for decisions, phase state, handoffs, errors. Every agent produces structured output in `/logs/`. Agents read journal files to recover state across sessions.
- **Context Window Management** (`docs/methods/CONTEXT_MANAGEMENT.md`) — session scoping guide, load-on-demand protocol, file size discipline, context checkpointing, emergency recovery.
- **Job queue pattern** (`docs/patterns/job-queue.ts`) — background jobs with idempotency keys, exponential backoff retry, dead letter queue, graceful shutdown. Includes BullMQ, Celery (Django), and Sidekiq (Rails) implementations.
- **Multi-tenancy pattern** (`docs/patterns/multi-tenant.ts`) — workspace scoping middleware, tenant-scoped services, role-based access control. Includes Next.js, Django, and Rails implementations.
- **Error handling pattern** (`docs/patterns/error-handling.ts`) — canonical error strategy: custom error types, global handler, response shape, operational vs programmer errors. Includes Express, Django, and Rails implementations.
- **Regression checklist template** in QA_ENGINEER.md — concrete table format with example entries, growth rules (2-3 items per feature, by launch: 30-50 items)
- **First-deploy pre-flight checklist** in `/devops` command — env vars, secrets, DB seeding, DNS, SSL, health check, rollback test, monitoring, security review
- **Phase rollback strategy** in BUILD_PROTOCOL.md and TROUBLESHOOTING.md — identify, revert, verify, isolate, fix, re-apply, log
- **Test execution timeline** in BUILD_PROTOCOL.md — authoritative table of which tests are written in which phase, all marked as breaking gates
- **Frontmatter validation table** in BUILD_PROTOCOL.md — valid values for each PRD field, defaults when missing
- **Parallel phase marking** in BUILD_PROTOCOL.md — each phase marked as parallelizable or strictly sequential
- **Multi-agent conflict resolution** in SUB_AGENTS.md — escalation protocol: check PRD, present trade-offs to user, document as ADR. Common conflict patterns with resolutions.
- **Framework-to-test-runner mapping** in TESTING.md — table covering Next.js, Express, Django, Rails, Go, Spring Boot
- **Batman scope clarification** — explicitly cross-cutting investigator + validator

### Changed
- **CLAUDE.md** — added build journal and context management references, "small batches" defined (max ~200 lines), error-handling.ts as canonical source, deduped from README
- **BUILD_PROTOCOL.md** — rewritten with specific verification gates (manual + automated criteria per phase), test execution timeline, rollback strategy, frontmatter validation, parallel phase marking, small batch definition (~200 lines), logging integrated at every phase
- **All 6 slash commands** — rewritten from pointers to self-contained executable sequences with inline steps, context setup, parallel analysis phases, logging instructions, and handoff protocols
- **SUB_AGENTS.md** — Agent tool section clarified (parallel analysis, not parallel coding), git coordination for multi-session, conflict resolution expanded with tiebreaker protocol
- **QA_ENGINEER.md** — added Scope section clarifying cross-cutting role, regression checklist template with format and rules
- **TESTING.md** — added framework-to-test-runner mapping table at top
- **TROUBLESHOOTING.md** — added phase rollback protocol section
- **All 4 original pattern files** — added framework adaptation notes (Express, Django, Rails, Vue, Svelte)
- **patterns/README.md** — updated table with all 7 patterns, framework columns
- **new-project.sh** — creates `/logs/` directory, copies all new files
- **DevOps slash command** — adapts based on PRD `deploy` target (vps/vercel/railway/docker/static), includes first-deploy checklist
