## [3.3.1] - 2026-03-13

### Fixed
- **PRD generation silently truncating** — output was hard-coded to 8192 max tokens, causing complex PRDs to cut off mid-stream with no warning. Now uses each model's full output capacity (Opus 32K, Sonnet 16K, Haiku 8K).
- **No truncation feedback** — server now tracks `stop_reason` from the Claude API `message_delta` event and forwards a `truncated` signal to the client, which displays a visible warning instead of silently accepting incomplete output.

---

## [3.3.0] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- **Async resource polling** — Strange now waits for RDS (up to 15min) and ElastiCache (up to 5min) to become available, extracts real endpoints (`DB_HOST`, `REDIS_HOST`), and writes them to `.env`. No more "check the AWS Console." (ADR-009)
- **Domain registration via Cloudflare Registrar** — buy a domain through Strange as a pre-DNS step. Registration creates the zone, then DNS records are created in it. Includes availability check, price display, and non-refundable purchase confirmation gate. (ADR-010)
- **Cloudflare Account ID** field in Cloud Providers — required for domain registration, validated as 32-char hex on save
- **Post-failure registration verification** — if the registration API times out, Strange re-checks availability to detect masked successes before reporting failure

### Changed
- **Partial success UI** — if infrastructure provisions but domain/DNS fails, Strange shows "partial success" with guidance instead of binary pass/fail
- **Output display** — infra details on the Done page are now grouped logically (server → DB → cache → platform → domain → DNS) with human-readable date formatting for domain expiry
- **AbortController integration** — polling loops cancel cleanly when the client disconnects instead of running for up to 15 minutes server-side
- **HTTP client** — single retry on transient errors (ECONNRESET, ETIMEDOUT) with 2s delay; per-call timeout override (60s for registration)
- **Polling jitter** — random interval variation prevents API throttling under concurrent use
- **ADR-009** corrected to reflect actual AbortController implementation
- **Cloudflare DNS** accepts `pending` zones from fresh domain registrations (previously required `active`)

### Fixed
- **Terminal failure detection** — RDS/ElastiCache polling breaks immediately on `failed`/`deleted`/`create-failed` states instead of waiting for timeout
- **Cleanup handling** — resources in "creating" state get a manual-cleanup warning instead of a silent deletion failure
- **Asymmetric token check** — all combinations of missing Cloudflare credentials now emit clear skip messages
- **404 availability fallback** — notes that availability is unconfirmed when domain is simply absent from the account
- **Registration row** hidden for Docker (local) deploys and invalid hostnames
- **`state.deployCmd`** declared in initial state object

### Security
- **CSRF protection** — `X-VoidForge-Request` custom header required on all POST requests; triggers CORS preflight to block cross-origin form submissions
- **DB_PASSWORD stripped from SSE** — password stays in `.env` only, never sent to the browser
- **AWS error sanitization** — ARNs, account IDs, and internal identifiers no longer leak to the client
- **`.env` file permissions** — `chmod 600` applied after generation, matching SSH key protection
- **Provisioning concurrency lock** — returns 429 if a run is already in progress
- **`encodeURIComponent(accountId)`** on all Cloudflare API URL interpolations — prevents path injection
- **Domain + Account ID validation** at client, server, and registrar layers
- **Random password suffix** replaces static `A1!` — uppercase + digit + special char now randomized
- **Hostname allowlist** documented in HTTP client module

---

## [3.2.0] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- **`/void` slash command** — Bombadil's Forge Sync. Self-update mechanism that fetches the latest VoidForge methodology from the scaffold branch, compares every shared file, shows a human-readable update plan, and applies changes while preserving project-specific customizations (PRD, logs, code, CLAUDE.md project section). Works on all three tiers.
- **Forge Keeper method doc** (`docs/methods/FORGE_KEEPER.md`) — Bombadil's protocol with 5-step update sequence, sub-agent roster (Goldberry, Treebeard, Radagast), shared file manifest, edge cases, and rollback guidance
- **Bombadil** (Tolkien) as 8th lead agent — Tom Bombadil, the Forge Keeper. Ancient, joyful, sings while he works. Tends the forge itself while others forge applications.
- **Goldberry** added to Tolkien character pool — River-daughter, upstream change detection
- ADR-008 (scaffold branch as update source for /void)

### Changed
- **Command count** updated from 7 to 8 across CLAUDE.md, README, and Holocron
- **`.claude/settings.json` excluded from Bombadil's sync scope** — user permissions and hooks are never overwritten (Picard's architecture review finding)
- **Semver comparison** in `/void` uses integer parsing, not string comparison — prevents incorrect results for versions like 3.10.x vs 3.9.x (Picard's architecture review finding)

---

## [3.1.0] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- **PRD-driven EC2 instance type selection** — PRD frontmatter `instance_type` field recommends t3.micro/small/medium/large based on project scope (database, cache, workers, payments, framework). Strange wizard shows the recommendation with cost estimates and allows override. RDS and ElastiCache sizes match automatically. (ADR-005)
- **Cloudflare DNS wiring** — new `hostname` field in Merlin wizard and PRD frontmatter. After Strange provisions infrastructure, it auto-creates Cloudflare DNS records (A for VPS, CNAME for platforms) pointing your domain at the provisioned resource. Works with all deploy targets. Non-fatal — infrastructure still succeeds if DNS fails. (ADR-006)
- **Platform custom domain registration** — Strange now registers your hostname directly with Vercel, Railway, and Cloudflare Pages via their APIs, so the platform expects traffic on your domain
- **Caddyfile auto-HTTPS** — when hostname is set, generated Caddyfile uses the domain instead of `:80`, enabling automatic Let's Encrypt SSL via Caddy
- **Instance sizing module** (`wizard/lib/instance-sizing.ts`) — scoring heuristic with `recommendInstanceType()`, RDS/ElastiCache size mapping, swap scaling
- **DNS module** (`wizard/lib/dns/`) — Cloudflare zone lookup, record CRUD, post-provision orchestration, cleanup support
- ADRs 005 (instance type selection), 006 (DNS as post-provision step), 007 (hostname vs domain naming)

### Changed
- **Provision script swap size** scales with instance type (2GB for micro/small, 1GB for medium, none for large)
- **Cloudflare help text** updated to recommend Zone:DNS:Edit token permission for DNS wiring
- **Architecture doc** updated with DNS in system diagram and new ADR references

---

## [3.0.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- **The VoidForge Holocron** (`HOLOCRON.md`) — comprehensive 9-chapter user guide covering setup, first project walkthrough, build protocol, agent system, slash commands, code patterns, build journal, troubleshooting, and evolution. Named after the Star Wars knowledge devices.
- **Three-tier distribution** — VoidForge now ships on three branches: `main` (full wizard), `scaffold` (methodology only), `core` (ultra-light drop-in). Each has its own README, release, and install path.
- **Branch sync rules** in CLAUDE.md — shared methodology files (agents, methods, patterns, commands) must propagate across all three branches.

### Changed
- **README restructured** — stripped down to pure system reference (architecture, components, tables). All walkthrough and guide content moved to the Holocron.
- **Semver rules updated** — MAJOR now includes distribution model changes.
- **VoidForge is now designed for external adoption** — three install paths, comprehensive guide, clean separation between system reference and user guide.

---

## [2.8.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- **Wizard split into Merlin (setup) and Strange (deploy)** — `npx voidforge init` launches the setup wizard, `npx voidforge deploy` launches the deploy wizard. Provisioning moved from Merlin to Strange for cleaner separation of concerns.
- **Architecture docs** — `ARCHITECTURE.md` (system overview + diagram), `SCALING.md` (three-tier assessment), `TECH_DEBT.md` (prioritized catalog), `FAILURE_MODES.md` (component failure analysis with recovery procedures)
- **Security checklist** — `SECURITY_CHECKLIST.md`, reusable pre-deploy verification list covering secrets, vault, server, AWS provisioning, generated infrastructure, input validation, and dependencies

### Changed
- **Merlin UI simplified** — removed provisioning steps (now in Strange). Merlin focuses on vault, credentials, project setup, PRD, and scaffold creation.

### Fixed
- **QA fixes** for Merlin/Strange restructure
- **UX polish** for Strange deploy wizard

### Security
- **DB/Redis security group ports** restricted from `0.0.0.0/0` (internet-open) to self-referencing security group (SG-only). Prevents database and Redis exposure to the internet.
- **Security headers** added to local server: `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `Content-Security-Policy`, `Referrer-Policy`, `Permissions-Policy`
- **Error message sanitization** — API error responses no longer leak internal details (file paths, stack traces). Real errors logged server-side only.

---

## [2.7.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- **Real API provisioning** for all deploy targets — Vercel creates projects, Railway creates projects with database/Redis services, Cloudflare creates Pages projects with D1 databases, Static S3 creates buckets with website hosting. All verified with live infrastructure.
- **Shared HTTP client** for provisioner API calls with safe JSON parsing and slug generation
- **Crash recovery cleanup** — orphaned resources from process crashes can now be cleaned up after server restart via disk-persisted manifests
- **SSE keepalive** on provisioning and PRD generation streams — prevents proxy/VPN/browser timeouts with 15-second heartbeats and event IDs
- **VoidForge favicon** — purple void portal icon

### Changed
- **Generated deploy scripts** use release-directory strategy with atomic symlink swap, post-deploy health check, and automatic rollback on failure. Keeps last 5 releases.
- **Generated provision scripts** include fail2ban, SSH hardening (no root/password), unattended security updates, 2GB swap, and log rotation
- **Generated Caddyfile** includes HSTS, Content-Security-Policy, and Permissions-Policy headers
- **Generated Dockerfiles** include HEALTHCHECK instructions. Build errors no longer silenced.
- **Generated docker-compose** uses env var DB passwords (not hardcoded), internal-only ports for DB/Redis, and app health checks
- **Generated PM2 config** includes crash-loop protection and graceful reload timeouts
- **Done page** shows target-specific deploy commands, human-readable labels, clickable URLs, and free tier/cost info
- **Railway** terminology updated from "plugins" to "services"

### Fixed
- Safe JSON parsing on all external API responses — no more crashes on HTML error pages
- S3 cleanup paginates object listing — handles buckets with more than 1000 objects
- Slugify strips leading/trailing hyphens and provides fallback for empty slugs
- Cloudflare D1 database only created for SQLite projects, not Postgres
- Railway token validation works with API tokens (not just user sessions)
- Help button now expands provider accordion when collapsed
- Vercel and Cloudflare 409 (project exists) paths track resources for cleanup

### Security
- Generated Caddyfile: HSTS, CSP, Permissions-Policy headers
- Generated provision.sh: fail2ban, SSH hardening, firewall lock-down-first
- Generated docker-compose: DB passwords from environment variables, database/Redis ports internal-only
- All 4 ADRs now implemented: provision manifest, atomic vault writes, API response validation, SSE keepalive

---

## [2.6.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- **Auto-provisioning system** — wizard steps 8 + 9. After project creation, provision infrastructure for your chosen deploy target with live SSE-streamed progress.
- **Docker provisioner** — generates Dockerfile (multi-stage per framework), docker-compose.yml (with optional Postgres/MySQL/Redis services), and .dockerignore
- **AWS VPS provisioner** — full EC2 + security group + SSH key pair provisioning, with optional RDS (Postgres/MySQL) and ElastiCache (Redis). Generates deploy scripts (provision.sh, deploy.sh, rollback.sh), Caddyfile, and PM2 ecosystem config.
- **Config-only provisioners** — Vercel (vercel.json), Railway (railway.toml), Cloudflare (wrangler.toml), Static S3 (deploy-s3.sh)
- **Provisioning API** — `POST /api/provision/start` (SSE-streamed), `POST /api/provision/cleanup`, `GET /api/provision/incomplete` for crash recovery
- **Provision manifest** (ADR-001) — write-ahead resource tracking at `~/.voidforge/runs/` prevents orphaned AWS resources on crash
- **Pre-provisioning confirmation gate** — users see what will be created (and AWS cost warning) before clicking "Start Provisioning"
- **4 Architecture Decision Records** — provision manifest, atomic vault writes, API response validation, SSE keepalive
- **QA regression checklist** — 24-item checklist covering all provisioning flows, a11y, and mobile

### Changed
- **Vault writes are now atomic** (ADR-002) — write-to-temp + fsync + rename prevents credential loss on crash
- **Wizard expanded to 9 steps** — step 8 (provision with confirmation gate) and step 9 (done with infra details)
- **User-controlled transitions** — replaced auto-advance with explicit "Continue" button for a11y
- **Advanced setup card** — updated copy from "Infrastructure provisioning in future phases" to "Automatic infrastructure provisioning"

### Fixed
- **JS injection** in PM2 config via project names containing quotes — now uses `JSON.stringify`
- **S3 deploy script** — added missing `--exclude '*'` before `--include` flags
- **RDS/EC2 networking** — RDS instance now shares security group with EC2; DB/Redis ports added to SG
- **RDS password** — generated with `crypto.randomBytes` instead of predictable slug-based derivation
- **Skip provisioning** — now aborts in-flight fetch via AbortController
- **Cleanup race condition** — resources tracked per run ID instead of global mutable state
- **Security group cleanup** — retry loop with 10s intervals instead of insufficient 5s sleep
- **Empty SSH key** — validates AWS returns key material before writing file
- **Rollback script** — framework-aware restart commands (Django/Rails) instead of hardcoded npm/PM2

### Security
- **Atomic vault writes** prevent credential file corruption
- **DB password masked** on wizard done page (shown as bullet characters)
- **`.ssh/` added to .gitignore** — prevents accidental deploy key commits

---

## [2.5.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- **`/git` slash command** (`.claude/commands/git.md`) — Coulson's version & release management. 7-step flow: orient, analyze diffs, determine semver bump, write changelog, craft commit, verify consistency, optional push. 5 Marvel sub-agents (Vision, Friday, Wong, Rogers, Barton).
- **Release Manager protocol** (`docs/methods/RELEASE_MANAGER.md`) — Coulson's method doc with semver rules, changelog writing guidelines, commit message format, and verification checklist. Works for VoidForge and generic projects.
- **Coulson** (Marvel) as 7th lead agent — S.H.I.E.L.D.'s meticulous record-keeper for version management
- **Friday** added to Marvel character pool in NAMING_REGISTRY.md — AI assistant for versioning and automation

### Changed
- **CLAUDE.md** — added `/git` to Slash Commands table, Coulson to The Team table, Release Manager to Docs Reference
- **README.md** — added `/git` to commands table, Coulson to leads table, updated command count to 7, added git.md and RELEASE_MANAGER.md to repo structure

---

## [2.4.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- **Cloud provider management** — new credential validation and storage for AWS, Vercel, Railway, and Cloudflare. Live API validation (STS, GraphQL, token verify) with vault-encrypted storage.
- **Deploy target selection** in wizard — choose deployment platform based on which providers have valid credentials. Docker always available.
- **Deploy target in `.env`** — scaffolded projects include `DEPLOY_TARGET` when a platform is selected

### Changed
- **Wizard UI overhaul** — redesigned credential step with provider cards, inline help, validation feedback. Expanded wizard flow with cloud and deploy target integration.
- **Vault concurrency** — all vault operations now serialized through a write queue to prevent race conditions on concurrent requests
- **Async key derivation** — PBKDF2 moved from sync to async to avoid blocking the event loop during encryption/decryption

### Fixed
- **Command injection** in browser launcher — replaced `exec` with `execFile` to prevent shell interpretation of URLs
- **Directory traversal** in static file server — replaced naive `..` stripping with `resolve()` + prefix check
- **SSE crash on client disconnect** — PRD generation stream now safely no-ops when the client has disconnected
- **CORS wildcard** — scoped `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` to the wizard's actual origin instead of `*`
- **Error detail leaking** — API error responses no longer include internal error bodies or stack traces
- **Password length cap** — vault unlock rejects passwords over 256 characters (DoS prevention)

### Removed
- **`claude` dependency** — removed unused package from dependencies

---

## [2.3.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- **Interactive setup wizard** (`wizard/`) — browser-based onboarding launched via `npm run wizard`. 5-step flow: credential vault, project setup, PRD creation, review, create.
- **Encrypted credential vault** (`wizard/lib/vault.ts`) — AES-256-GCM with PBKDF2 key derivation, stored at `~/.voidforge/vault.enc`. Cross-platform (macOS, Linux, Windows). Users manage the password however they like.
- **PRD generation with Claude** — streams a full PRD from a product idea using the best available model (auto-resolved via `/v1/models` API). Primary path in the wizard.
- **Bring Your Own PRD** tab — copy the generator prompt to clipboard for use with any AI (ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.), paste the result back with frontmatter validation.
- **Project scaffolding** — TypeScript port of `new-project.sh` logic with git init, CLAUDE.md substitution, .env generation.
- **CLI entry point** (`scripts/voidforge.ts`) — `npx voidforge init` launches the wizard.
- **Dynamic model resolution** (`wizard/lib/anthropic.ts`) — fetches available models from Anthropic API, picks newest Opus > Sonnet > Haiku. No hardcoded model IDs.
- **Frontmatter parser** (`wizard/lib/frontmatter.ts`) — YAML frontmatter extraction and validation for PRD documents.
- `tsconfig.json`, TypeScript and tsx dev dependencies.

### Changed
- **README.md** — wizard is now the primary Quick Start path. Manual setup is an alternative section. Repository structure updated to include `wizard/` and `scripts/voidforge.ts`.
- **`new-project.sh`** — comment noting `wizard/` exclusion from project copies.
- **`package.json`** — added `bin` field, `wizard` and `typecheck` scripts, `type: "module"`.

---

## [2.2.0] - 2026-03-12

### Changed

- **PostToolUse hook format** in `.claude/settings.json` — migrated from flat `command` field to nested `hooks` array structure per current Claude Code schema

---

## [2.1.0] - 2026-03-10

### Added
- **Build Journal system** (`docs/methods/BUILD_JOURNAL.md`) — persistent logging protocol for decisions, phase state, handoffs, errors. Every agent produces structured output in `/logs/`. Agents read journal files to recover state across sessions.
- **Context Window Management** (`docs/methods/CONTEXT_MANAGEMENT.md`) — session scoping guide, load-on-demand protocol, file size discipline, context checkpointing, emergency recovery.
- **Job queue pattern** (`docs/patterns/job-queue.ts`) — background jobs with idempotency keys, exponential backoff retry, dead letter queue, graceful shutdown. Includes BullMQ, Celery (Django), and Sidekiq (Rails) implementations.

- **Error handling pattern** (`docs/patterns/error-handling.ts`) — canonical error strategy: custom error types, global handler, response shape, operational vs programmer errors. Includes Express, Django, and Rails implementations.
- **Regression checklist template** in QA_ENGINEER.md — concrete table format with example entries, growth rules (2-3 items per feature, by launch: 30-50 items)
- **First-deploy pre-flight checklist** in `/devops` command — env vars, secrets, DB seeding, DNS, SSL, health check, rollback test, monitoring, security review
- **Phase rollback strategy** in BUILD_PROTOCOL.md and TROUBLESHOOTING.md — identify, revert, verify, isolate, fix, re-apply, log
- **Test execution timeline** in BUILD_PROTOCOL.md — authoritative table of which tests are written in which phase, all marked as breaking gates
- **Frontmatter validation table** in BUILD_PROTOCOL.md — valid values for each PRD field, defaults when missing
- **Parallel phase marking** in BUILD_PROTOCOL.md — each phase marked as parallelizable or strictly sequential
- **Multi-agent conflict resolution** in SUB_AGENTS.md — escalation protocol: check PRD, present trade-offs to user, document as ADR. Common conflict patterns with resolutions.
- **Framework-to-test-runner mapping** in TESTING.md — table covering Next.js, Express, Django, Rails, Go, Spring Boot
- **Batman scope clarification** — explicitly cross-cutting investigator + validator

### Changed
