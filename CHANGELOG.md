## [2.4.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- **Cloud provider management** — new credential validation and storage for AWS, Vercel, Railway, and Cloudflare. Live API validation (STS, GraphQL, token verify) with vault-encrypted storage.
- **Deploy target selection** in wizard — choose deployment platform based on which providers have valid credentials. Docker always available.
- **Deploy target in `.env`** — scaffolded projects include `DEPLOY_TARGET` when a platform is selected

### Changed
- **Wizard UI overhaul** — redesigned credential step with provider cards, inline help, validation feedback. Expanded wizard flow with cloud and deploy target integration.
- **Vault concurrency** — all vault operations now serialized through a write queue to prevent race conditions on concurrent requests
- **Async key derivation** — PBKDF2 moved from sync to async to avoid blocking the event loop during encryption/decryption

### Fixed
- **Command injection** in browser launcher — replaced `exec` with `execFile` to prevent shell interpretation of URLs
- **Directory traversal** in static file server — replaced naive `..` stripping with `resolve()` + prefix check
- **SSE crash on client disconnect** — PRD generation stream now safely no-ops when the client has disconnected
- **CORS wildcard** — scoped `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` to the wizard's actual origin instead of `*`
- **Error detail leaking** — API error responses no longer include internal error bodies or stack traces
- **Password length cap** — vault unlock rejects passwords over 256 characters (DoS prevention)

### Removed
- **`claude` dependency** — removed unused package from dependencies

---

## [2.3.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- **Interactive setup wizard** (`wizard/`) — browser-based onboarding launched via `npm run wizard`. 5-step flow: credential vault, project setup, PRD creation, review, create.
- **Encrypted credential vault** (`wizard/lib/vault.ts`) — AES-256-GCM with PBKDF2 key derivation, stored at `~/.voidforge/vault.enc`. Cross-platform (macOS, Linux, Windows). Users manage the password however they like.
- **PRD generation with Claude** — streams a full PRD from a product idea using the best available model (auto-resolved via `/v1/models` API). Primary path in the wizard.
- **Bring Your Own PRD** tab — copy the generator prompt to clipboard for use with any AI (ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.), paste the result back with frontmatter validation.
- **Project scaffolding** — TypeScript port of `new-project.sh` logic with git init, CLAUDE.md substitution, .env generation.
- **CLI entry point** (`scripts/voidforge.ts`) — `npx voidforge init` launches the wizard.
- **Dynamic model resolution** (`wizard/lib/anthropic.ts`) — fetches available models from Anthropic API, picks newest Opus > Sonnet > Haiku. No hardcoded model IDs.
- **Frontmatter parser** (`wizard/lib/frontmatter.ts`) — YAML frontmatter extraction and validation for PRD documents.
- `tsconfig.json`, TypeScript and tsx dev dependencies.

### Changed
- **README.md** — wizard is now the primary Quick Start path. Manual setup is an alternative section. Repository structure updated to include `wizard/` and `scripts/voidforge.ts`.
- **`new-project.sh`** — comment noting `wizard/` exclusion from project copies.
- **`package.json`** — added `bin` field, `wizard` and `typecheck` scripts, `type: "module"`.

---

## [2.2.0] - 2026-03-12

### Changed
- **Project renamed to VoidForge** — "from nothing, everything." Replaced all references to `claude-scaffold` across README, scripts, package files, patterns, and version docs

---

## [2.1.1] - 2026-03-12

### Fixed
- **PostToolUse hook format** in `.claude/settings.json` — migrated from flat `command` field to nested `hooks` array structure per current Claude Code schema

---

## [2.1.0] - 2026-03-10

### Added
- **Build Journal system** (`docs/methods/BUILD_JOURNAL.md`) — persistent logging protocol for decisions, phase state, handoffs, errors. Every agent produces structured output in `/logs/`. Agents read journal files to recover state across sessions.
- **Context Window Management** (`docs/methods/CONTEXT_MANAGEMENT.md`) — session scoping guide, load-on-demand protocol, file size discipline, context checkpointing, emergency recovery.
- **Job queue pattern** (`docs/patterns/job-queue.ts`) — background jobs with idempotency keys, exponential backoff retry, dead letter queue, graceful shutdown. Includes BullMQ, Celery (Django), and Sidekiq (Rails) implementations.
- **Multi-tenancy pattern** (`docs/patterns/multi-tenant.ts`) — workspace scoping middleware, tenant-scoped services, role-based access control. Includes Next.js, Django, and Rails implementations.
- **Error handling pattern** (`docs/patterns/error-handling.ts`) — canonical error strategy: custom error types, global handler, response shape, operational vs programmer errors. Includes Express, Django, and Rails implementations.
- **Regression checklist template** in QA_ENGINEER.md — concrete table format with example entries, growth rules (2-3 items per feature, by launch: 30-50 items)
- **First-deploy pre-flight checklist** in `/devops` command — env vars, secrets, DB seeding, DNS, SSL, health check, rollback test, monitoring, security review
- **Phase rollback strategy** in BUILD_PROTOCOL.md and TROUBLESHOOTING.md — identify, revert, verify, isolate, fix, re-apply, log
- **Test execution timeline** in BUILD_PROTOCOL.md — authoritative table of which tests are written in which phase, all marked as breaking gates
- **Frontmatter validation table** in BUILD_PROTOCOL.md — valid values for each PRD field, defaults when missing
- **Parallel phase marking** in BUILD_PROTOCOL.md — each phase marked as parallelizable or strictly sequential
- **Multi-agent conflict resolution** in SUB_AGENTS.md — escalation protocol: check PRD, present trade-offs to user, document as ADR. Common conflict patterns with resolutions.
- **Framework-to-test-runner mapping** in TESTING.md — table covering Next.js, Express, Django, Rails, Go, Spring Boot
- **Batman scope clarification** — explicitly cross-cutting investigator + validator

### Changed
- **CLAUDE.md** — added build journal and context management references, "small batches" defined (max ~200 lines), error-handling.ts as canonical source, deduped from README
- **BUILD_PROTOCOL.md** — rewritten with specific verification gates (manual + automated criteria per phase), test execution timeline, rollback strategy, frontmatter validation, parallel phase marking, small batch definition (~200 lines), logging integrated at every phase
- **All 6 slash commands** — rewritten from pointers to self-contained executable sequences with inline steps, context setup, parallel analysis phases, logging instructions, and handoff protocols
- **SUB_AGENTS.md** — Agent tool section clarified (parallel analysis, not parallel coding), git coordination for multi-session, conflict resolution expanded with tiebreaker protocol
- **QA_ENGINEER.md** — added Scope section clarifying cross-cutting role, regression checklist template with format and rules
- **TESTING.md** — added framework-to-test-runner mapping table at top
- **TROUBLESHOOTING.md** — added phase rollback protocol section
- **All 4 original pattern files** — added framework adaptation notes (Express, Django, Rails, Vue, Svelte)
- **patterns/README.md** — updated table with all 7 patterns, framework columns
- **new-project.sh** — creates `/logs/` directory, copies all new files
- **DevOps slash command** — adapts based on PRD `deploy` target (vps/vercel/railway/docker/static), includes first-deploy checklist
