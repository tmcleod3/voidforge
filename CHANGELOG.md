## [23.27.0] - 2026-07-14

### Field Report Triage — #406 closed (command↔doc mandatory-sync gate, count-drift sweep, behavior-change sweep)

`/debrief --inbox` triaged the last open field report — #406, a self-filed finding from the v23.26.0→v23.26.1 session where *mandatory* method-doc additions shipped without their paired command files (6 command files a version behind their method docs) and a follow-on `/review` had to catch it, forcing an entire extra patch. All three root causes accepted and applied; the release command now enforces mechanically what the prior session found only by hand.

- **Changed** — **RC-1 (HIGH): Command↔Doc Sync is now a release gate, not advice.** `/git` Step 5.5 and `RELEASE_MANAGER.md` Step 5.75 now classify each method-doc addition. A **mandatory** addition — a step marked MANDATORY, or a discrete *executable* procedure (a curl/probe, a required sweep, a numbered gate, a required checklist item the agent runs) — **must** have its paired `.claude/commands/*.md` file updated in the same release; a release does not push with a mandatory method-doc addition left unsynced. Advisory context (rationale, examples) still delegates to the user. The rule is named in `SUB_AGENTS.md` ("Mandatory Method-Doc Step → Paired Command File Must Sync"): the command file is the executable spec the agent runs from — a mandatory step living only in the method doc never changes behavior. Added as a Verification-Checklist line.
- **Added** — **RC-2 (MED): release-time count-drift sweep.** New `/git` Step 5.7 (Count-Drift Sweep) computes ground truth (`ls … | wc -l`) for agents/patterns/commands and greps the human-facing docs for stale scalars, preferring SSOT pointers over hardcoded numbers. `BUILD_PROTOCOL.md` Principle #11 now points at this enforcement and it's a Verification-Checklist line — the "derived counts discipline" was documented but unenforced, and drifted patterns/commands/tests across README/HOLOCRON/CLAUDE.md every release until now.
- **Changed** — **RC-3 (MED): Removal Sweep → Removal & Behavior-Change Sweep.** `/git` Step 3.5 and the `RELEASE_MANAGER.md` section generalize from *removed names* to *altered behaviors*: when a fix changes (not just deletes) a documented behavior, grep the tree for docs/examples that still teach the OLD behavior and reconcile them the same release — the general form of the v23.26.0 miss where a bounded-verify fix left three docs still teaching the unbounded pattern it removed.
- **Changed** — `/git` Steps 5.5 and 5.7 relocated to sit between Step 5 (Verify) and Step 6 (Push), where a pre-push gate belongs; they had been physically placed after Step 7 (Publish), so a gate whose own text says "do not proceed to Push" was documented after the publish step.

No methodology behavior removed. Docs-only release; both packages bumped in lockstep. Dep `^23.26.1` → `^23.27.0`.

## [23.26.1] - 2026-07-14

### Documentation-accuracy pass — 12-agent `/review` (command↔method sync, count drift, #405 doc loop-closers)

A full Silver-Surfer `/review` over the whole repo after v23.26.0. The release itself verified sound (0 literal defects, 19/22 claims confirmed, VERSION↔CHANGELOG consistent); the fixes are currency/sync drift — most of it pre-existing — applied across 21 files by a 12-agent roster.

- **Fixed** — **command files now match their method docs.** `qa.md`/`gauntlet.md`/`ux.md`/`sentinel.md`/`campaign.md`/`prd.md` gained the mandatory steps their method docs shipped in v23.26.0 (generated-media route probe, adjacent credential-store sweep, review-finding premise re-check, live-arming, hardware-in-loop category, positioning intake). The executable command specs were silently a release behind the method docs — the #404 probe alone had landed in 4 method docs but 0 command files.
- **Fixed** — **#405 doc loop-closers.** `gauntlet.md`, `WORKFLOWS.md`'s canonical-shape example, and `GAUNTLET.md`'s Confidence PRINCIPLE + `--infinity` section no longer describe the pre-#405 unbounded "3-lens on every claim" verify — they reflect the severity-triaged, budget-guarded behavior (an `--infinity` run could otherwise have re-breached the ~1,000-agent cap).
- **Fixed** — **count drift.** README / HOLOCRON / CLAUDE.md corrected to 33 commands / 57 pattern implementations and softened to SSOT pointers where drift-prone; `deploy-preflight.ts` added to the CLAUDE.md pattern list; `DOC_AUDIT.md` + `SPEC_HANDOFF.md` added to the Docs Reference; `SECURITY_AUDITOR.md` Operating Rules duplicate 7/8 renumbered to 9/10/11.
- **Changed** — **code hardening.** Unknown/malformed severity now fails SAFE to HIGH (verified, not silently skipped) in both the gauntlet and assemble-review workflows; assemble-review crossfire is now severity-triaged with a `crossfireRefutedLog` (no silent drops); `validate-workflows.sh`'s budget-token + nested-fan-out detector were tightened against false-positive/false-negative; `docs/patterns/git-sha-resolve.sh` packed-refs match is now exact-field (`awk '$2==r'`) — no regex misfire on metacharacter branch names, no `main`/`mainline` substring false-match.
- **Fixed** — DevOps runbooks: `credential-store-migration.md` system-cron step now searches contents (`grep -rlnE`) instead of listing dirs (`ls`); `DEVOPS_ENGINEER.md` notes `pkill -F` is a Linux-only extension (macOS caveat).

No methodology behavior removed. Both packages bumped in lockstep. Dep `^23.26.0` → `^23.26.1`.

## [23.26.0] - 2026-07-14

### Field Report Triage — 10 reports closed (#393–#399, #402, #404, #405)

`/debrief --inbox` triaged all 10 open field reports against the post-v23.25.0 tree and applied every accepted fix across 19 files (17 modified + 2 new patterns), verified green (1429 tests; both workflows validate).

- **Fixed** — **`/gauntlet` 1000-agent-cap breach (#405):** the `gauntlet.workflow.js` verify phase ran `claims × 3` lenses on ALL severities with no cap and aborted mid-run on a whole-codebase audit (516 claims → ~1,548 agents → `WorkflowAgentCapError`). Now severity-triaged — Critical/High → full 3-lens REFUTE, Medium → batched skeptic (N-per-agent via a new `BATCH_VERDICT` schema), Low/Warn → advisory (zero verify agents) — under a hard `VERIFY_AGENT_BUDGET` that logs every deferred Critical/High by title+file (never a silent drop). The same split is applied to crossfire verify and to `assemble-review.workflow.js`. Re-aligns the workflow with `GAUNTLET.md` Step 4.5, where the severity bound was also the scaling bound.
- **Added** — two patterns: `docs/patterns/credential-store-migration.md` (pre-irreversible-deletion consumer gate across crontab/systemd/PM2/shells, then post-delete liveness proof; #394) and `docs/patterns/git-sha-resolve.sh` (loose → `packed-refs` → `git rev-parse` fallback so a `/healthz` git_sha survives `git gc`; #397). New method-doc rules: generated-media route probe (#404 F1 — `curl -sI` → 200 + `image/*` across `PRODUCT_DESIGN_FRONTEND.md`, `QA_ENGINEER.md`, `GAUNTLET.md`), producer→consumer end-to-end trace (#395), a post-build **live-arming phase** (#399), interaction-path completeness for animations (#402 F2 / #404 F3), a hardware-in-loop mission gate (#404 F4), review-finding premise re-check (CAMPAIGN rule 5.2, #402 F1 / #404 F2), per-mission ADR/ROADMAP status (rule 5.3, #394), adjacent plaintext credential-store sweep (#394), systemd `ReadWritePaths=` deletion gate + `pkill -f` self-match (#396/#394), positioning intake question (#404 F5), rate-limit stall recovery (#402 F3), and a file-issue-before-citing discipline (#393 RC-1).
- **Changed** — `WORKFLOWS.md` Gotcha 4 promoted to a prescriptive nested-fan-out budget-assertion rule + capped canonical example, plus a new Gotcha (behavioral-delta comment for prose→workflow ports); `scripts/validate-workflows.sh` now **fails** a nested `parallel()` fan-out with no budget guard (#405 FIX-4). `updater.ts` now exports a single `WIRED_NOT_COPIED` SSOT consulted by both `diffMethodology` and `applyUpdate` so the copy-skip and diff planner cannot drift (#393 RC-2, durable). `CLAUDE.md` gains a Workflow-dispatch basename→display-name caveat in the roster-normalization step (#398). Batman/Kenobi/Kusanagi Operational Learnings updated.
- **Out of scope (Claude Code platform core — closed with note):** making the Workflow `agentType` resolver accept basenames (#398) and exposing per-agent status in the Workflow resume API (#402 F5) — the wizard does not implement the native Workflow tool; the documentation + recovery guidance VoidForge owns shipped. #402 F4 (context-meter window) was project-local; #399 item 4 (roster TTL) was already fixed (3600s + activity-slide).

Both packages bumped in lockstep. Dep `^23.25.0` → `^23.26.0`.

## [23.25.0] - 2026-06-26

### `update` auto-escalates a shadowed `/contextmeter` meter to Local scope (#392)

- **Changed** — `npx voidforge-build update` now applies the same non-destructive shadow resolution as the manual `/contextmeter`: when it detects a Project/User `statusLine` that would shadow the auto-wired meter, it **escalates the meter's `statusLine` to `.claude/settings.local.json` (Local scope)** — which outranks Project and User — so the meter wins **without touching the user's global `~/.claude/settings.json`**, and gitignores the Local file. If the competitor is itself a Local `statusLine`, the non-interactive `update` refuses to clobber it and instead warns + defers to `/contextmeter`. The update plan / `--dry-run` reports the escalation. +2 updater tests (1427→1429).

Both packages bumped in lockstep. Dep `^23.24.0` → `^23.25.0`.

## [23.24.0] - 2026-06-26

### `/contextmeter` shadow resolution: escalate to Local scope, never clobber the user's global statusLine (#392, verifies #390)

- **Verified** Claude Code's `statusLine` settings precedence — **Local (`.claude/settings.local.json`) > Project (`.claude/settings.json`) > User (`~/.claude/settings.json`)** — from the official docs *and* a live probe (a Local-scope statusLine hot-reloaded mid-session and fired 14× over the Project meter). This resolves the #390 contradiction: a Project meter already outranks a user-global statusLine, and Local outranks everything below Managed/CLI.
- **Changed** — when `/contextmeter` detects a competing statusLine, it now **escalates the meter to Local scope** (`.claude/settings.local.json`) so it wins **without modifying the user's global `~/.claude/settings.json`**. Global overwrite is now an explicit, backed-up opt-in (`--force-global`), never a silent default. `.claude/settings.local.json` is gitignored (per-machine). `--uninstall` clears the meter from both Project and Local scopes.
- **Why** — silently rewriting the user's machine-wide, cross-project config from a project-scoped command is the silent-destruction class (#331/#368) at global scope, and per the verified precedence it is unnecessary.

Both packages bumped in lockstep. Dep `^23.23.0` → `^23.24.0`.

## [23.23.0] - 2026-06-26

### Triage of #387 + #390 → `/contextmeter` shadow detection, gate auto-wire on update (+ opt-out), `/deploy` redirect

**#390 — `/contextmeter` install reports success but the meter is silently shadowed (HIGH):**

- **Fixed** — `statusLine` is a single-winner slot across the whole settings hierarchy, so a `statusLine` in `~/.claude/settings.json` (e.g. one the native `/statusline` wrote) or `.claude/settings.local.json` shadows the project meter even when the project install is correct. `/contextmeter` now: Step 0 cross-hierarchy shadow check; Step 2.1 collision rule broadened from project-only to the full hierarchy; `--status` reports "**installed but shadowed by `<file>`**" instead of a false-positive "wired." `update` emits a shadow **warning** when it auto-wires a meter a higher-precedence statusLine would shadow. `scripts/statusline/README.md` documents the single-winner behavior.

**#387 — init/update parity + distribution + `/deploy`:**

- **Changed** — `update` now auto-wires the Silver Surfer **gate** PreToolUse hook into existing projects too (init/update settings-wiring parity — every init-time `.claude/settings.json` merge now has an update-time counterpart), idempotent + non-clobbering. A new persistent **opt-out marker** — `.voidforge` `autowireOptOut: ["surfer-gate" | "contextmeter"]` — lets a project decline an auto-wire so the choice survives every future update; `/contextmeter --uninstall` records `"contextmeter"`.
- **Added** — `RELEASE_MANAGER.md`: a distribution copy of a whole shipped directory copies it wholesale, never via an extension allowlist (#387 RC-1, generalizing LRN-11 to file-*types* — the gap that dropped `.sh`/`.py`/`.conf` patterns from the package, fixed in v23.21.0).
- **Added** — `/deploy` Step 1 + `DEVOPS_ENGINEER.md`: detect a publish-only repo (no app target; `bin`/`publishConfig`/publish CI) and redirect to `/git --npm` or `/seal` instead of prompting for a deploy target.

Both packages bumped in lockstep. +4 updater tests (1423→1427). Dep `^23.22.0` → `^23.23.0`.

## [23.22.0] - 2026-06-24

### `update` now auto-activates `/contextmeter` (matches `init`)

- **Fixed** — `npx voidforge-build update` now wires the `/contextmeter` status line + `UserPromptSubmit` awareness hook into `.claude/settings.json`, the same default-on way `init` does. Previously `update` copied `scripts/statusline/` but left the meter inactive until you ran `/contextmeter` by hand. `mergeStatuslineSettings` is now shared by `init` and `update`; it stays idempotent and **non-clobbering** — never overwrites a project's own `statusLine`, never duplicates the awareness hook. `--dry-run` / diff now reports the pending `.claude/settings.json` change honestly (reading the snippet from the source so it's accurate even before the scripts are copied). +3 updater tests (suite 1420→1423).

Both packages bumped in lockstep (version-consistency gate). Dep `^23.21.0` → `^23.22.0`.

## [23.21.0] - 2026-06-24

### Triaged field reports #382 / #383 / #384 → `/seal`-hardening + DevOps/QA/orchestration fixes + a pattern-distribution gap

**From #384 (the v23.20.0 `/seal` session's own debrief):**

- **Added** — Release Step 0 *unrelated / pre-existing-change detection* (`/git`, `/seal`, `RELEASE_MANAGER.md`): before staging, the working tree is split into session-authored vs pre-existing/out-of-scope changes, with dependency manifests / lockfiles getting dependency-level scrutiny — the exact vigilance that caught the v23.20.0 `vercel` near-miss, now mechanical. Never `git add -A` a release.
- **Added** — *Creation-time native-collision gate* (`BUILD_PROTOCOL.md`, `NATIVE_CAPABILITIES.md`): a new command's name is checked against the native command/skill set *before* the file is written, and its `NATIVE_CAPABILITIES` row is added at creation — the check shifts left from release-time re-audit to command-creation (the `/statusline`→`/contextmeter` rework cause).
- **Fixed** — `scripts/surfer-gate/bypass.sh` *stale-pointer self-repair*: reads the live session id from `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` and repoints a pointer left by a `/clear`ed/crashed session, so a single `bypass.sh --light` lands correctly on the first try — no operator re-run. Older CLIs without the env var keep the documented re-run fallback. (+4 regression tests; gate suite 27→31.)

**From #382 (QA-isolation prod outage + sandbox / spend / coverage):**

- **Added** — `DEVOPS_ENGINEER.md`: locking a shared parent dir must enumerate every traversing service account and grant each an explicit traverse ACL, then `curl` the prod FE and assert 200 (a `/home/ubuntu` `0750` lock 500'd nginx). Plus a headless-OAuth-bootstrap note (SSH `-L` port-forward or paste-the-code fallback).
- **Added** — `docs/patterns/egress-sandbox.sh`: run a `systemd-run` egress-confined workload under `--uid`/`--gid` so artifacts stay user-owned, not root-owned — `IPAddress*` filtering is a cgroup property and uid-independent.
- **Added** — `SUB_AGENTS.md`: a global spend ceiling must reserve max-possible in-flight child budget before launching the next child (an $80 cap spent $83.72), or document the overshoot bound.
- **Added** — `QA_ENGINEER.md`: coverage honesty — count a case covered only at the fidelity actually exercised; record proof in a per-lane ledger; never reclassify a coverage SSOT on partial evidence.

**Distribution:**

- **Fixed** — `prepack.sh` / `copy-assets.sh` now ship **every** `docs/patterns/` file regardless of extension. Globbing by `.ts`/`.tsx`/`.md` had silently dropped the `.sh`/`.py`/`.conf` patterns (`post-deploy-probe.sh`, `nginx-vhost.conf`, `rls-test-fixture.py`, `structural-sql-sentinel.py`) from the published package — an LRN-11 gap, now a future-proof whole-dir copy.

**#383** (`/contextmeter`) shipped in v23.20.0 — closed as implemented; its creation-time-collision proposal is covered by #384 RC-2.

Build clean, suite 1420 (gate 27→31). Dep `^23.20.0` → `^23.21.0`.

## [23.20.0] - 2026-06-23

### Triaged 12 upstream field reports → methodology hardening, + `/seal` and `/contextmeter`

Ran `/debrief --inbox` over the 12 open field reports (#364–#378), applied every accepted fix across ~41 method docs / agents / patterns / commands (one applier per file, diff-coverage verified), implemented the two wizard-code reports, and shipped two new commands. All 12 issues closed. Build clean, full suite 1392 → 1420.

The recurring theme across the reports: **green static gates (build, unit tests, denylists, ADR claims, status codes, declared coverage) keep passing while the real runtime / scale / auth / external path is never exercised.**

### Added

- **`/seal`** — session-closeout ritual: `/git` commit → push → `/debrief --submit` → `/vault --seal`, then always prints the next-session handoff prompt. Fail-safe pipeline (a test failure halts before push but still seals a vault recording the blocked state). Thin orchestrator — no new persona.
- **`/contextmeter`** (Ducem Barr) — context-budget meter. A status line rendering a colored context-usage meter (green → yellow → red; yellow 80%, red 92%) plus a `UserPromptSubmit` hook that injects remaining-context awareness into Claude itself once usage crosses the threshold, so it can `/vault`/`/seal` before compaction. **Default-on:** `init` auto-wires it (new `mergeStatuslineSettings`, mirrors the surfer-gate hook merge; sets `statusLine` only if absent, appends the hook idempotently). Named to avoid the native `/statusline`/`/context` collision (logged in `NATIVE_CAPABILITIES.md`). `scripts/statusline/` wired through all four distribution paths + the npm `files` allowlist (LRN-11).
- **`docs/patterns/post-deploy-probe.sh`** — deploy probe asserting response content + Content-Type, not HTTP status only (defeats the SPA catch-all false-positive). [#371]
- **`docs/patterns/exclusion-set-invariant.md`** — superset invariant across `.gitignore` / rsync / secret-scanner exclusion sets. [#377]

### Changed — methodology hardening (#364–#378)

- **QA / Testing** [#378/#373/#365] — throughput/scale gate for per-row network stages; partial/edge-state smoke; drift-guard shared check-fn + CI-wiring proof.
- **Architecture** [#378/#373/#376] — ADR concurrency-claim verification gate; ADRs record provider-doc-verified token lifecycle; `architect` Step 4.6 extended to verify EXTERNAL platform claims vs live docs.
- **Security** [#378/#377] — PII export-format `.gitignore`; denylist = tripwire vs authoritative-boundary (prove reachability before escalating to CRITICAL).
- **DevOps** [#377/#365/#364] — production-path tracer for arming gates; live contrastive systemd/sandbox smoke; promote gate verifies deployed-commit == branch HEAD.
- **Gauntlet / Campaign** [#377/#373/#365/#371] — live runtime assertion on fix-batch acceptance; dark-flag activation gated on review (not deploy); declared-vs-implemented reconciliation lens; FR-A5 HTTP two-principal isolation + planted-uid red-check.
- **Frontend / UX** [#376/#375] — anti-generic originality gate (justify-or-reject named defaults); render-gate coverage (every changed-prop surface, both auth states).
- **Build / Release** [#376/#366/#364/#375] — "adversarially verify the as-implemented diff" step; distribution-validator rule; pre-integration web-verification; removal sweep.
- **AI safety** [#378/#364] — deny-list discipline (negation-adjacency / proper-noun allowlist / NFKC / independent eval); LLM per-token cost-constant staleness.
- **Sub-agents / Workflows** [#378/#377/#371/#366] — orchestrator owns dedup + dispatch; verify the empirical premise of a severity rating; auth-mechanism → client-gate-migration audit; mktemp scratch rule; WORKFLOWS recovery subsection.
- **Forge artist currency** [#367] — removed the retired DALL-E 3 HD provider row; gpt-image-1 throughout.
- **Wizard `update`** [#368/#369] — non-destructive CLAUDE.md merge (new `claude-md-strategy.ts`: preserve + side-file / sentinel-fence merge / skip; marker `claudeMd` field; `--help` guard; section-loss warning), replacing the destructive "preserve first 10 lines, overwrite the rest" clobber; legacy-consumer marker detection (offer to create the marker instead of erroring to `init`).

### Fixed

- **Silver Surfer gate `/debrief` gap** [#366-F4] — `/debrief` and other fixed-roster non-review commands take a `--light` / `--solo` bypass before launching sub-agents (the hook blocks *every* non-Surfer Agent launch regardless of the gated-commands list). Documented in `CLAUDE.md` + `debrief.md` + `FIELD_MEDIC.md`, including the live-observed `bypass.sh` stale-pointer bug + re-run workaround.
- **`gauntlet.workflow.js` dedup** [#366-F6] — strip the repo-root prefix from a finding's path before keying, so the same finding raised by two agents dedupes.

Dep `^23.19.0` → `^23.20.0`.

## [23.19.0] - 2026-06-13

### Gauntlet acceptance test → 14 fixes

The ADR-067 workflow re-platform validated by running `gauntlet.workflow.js` live on the v23.13–v23.18 platform code (a 10-agent Surfer roster fanned to 347 agents → 99 distinct claims → 66 confirmed + 24 crossfire, **0 Critical**). The acceptance test passed *and* surfaced real bugs; the 3-lens-confirmed High/Medium findings are fixed here. (An earlier run crashed the machine ~44 min in at peak load; the relaunch completed cleanly — the workflow is resumable via `resumeFromRunId`.)

### Fixed — Silver Surfer gate (security/correctness)

- **`_paths.sh` reap could delete the entire `sessions/` tree.** `find "$SESSIONS_DIR" -maxdepth 1 -type d -mmin +60` matches the search root itself; without `-mindepth 1` a stale `sessions/` root mtime made the sweep `rm -rf` every live session's roster + bypass flag. Added `-mindepth 1`.
- **Reap-vs-fresh-roster/bypass race (the one VERSION.md flagged for a field report).** The TTL refresh touched the roster *file* but the reaper keys on the session *directory* mtime (touching a child never bumps the parent). `check.sh` now touches `$SESSION_DIR` on every roster/bypass ALLOW, `bypass.sh` touches it on write, and the reap threshold (+120m) is held strictly above the roster TTL (3600s) — an active session is never reaped while still valid.
- **Gate silently broke on Alpine/minimal Linux:** `_paths.sh` hashed paths with `shasum` only (Perl, absent there). Added a `sha256sum` fallback via a shared `surfer_gate_repo_hash` helper.
- **`bypass.sh` run before the first hook fire was a silent no-op** (the documented orchestrator order). It now records a repo-scoped *pending* bypass that `check.sh` promotes to the session flag on the first fire.

### Fixed — Dynamic Workflow scripts

- **Strike phase double-ran the roster** when ≤5 agents (the default/`--light` core-leads set): `strikeRoster` fell back to the full roster, re-running discovery agents under a "find what discovery missed" prompt. Now empty when there are no specialists.
- **Crossfire `survives:true` + `finalSeverity:'REFUTED'` verdicts silently vanished** — kept as "confirmed" yet matched no council severity bucket. Now excluded and logged in `crossfireRefutedLog`, honoring the never-silently-dropped invariant.
- **Dedup kept the first raiser's severity**, discarding a later agent's higher rating. Now keeps the max severity and tracks `raisedBy` (gauntlet + assemble-review). assemble-review also gains a `refutedLog`.
- **Unguarded `JSON.parse(args)`** could crash the whole run before phase 1; now falls back to defaults. Undefined-`domain` roster items no longer render literal `undefined` in prompts.

### Fixed — distribution & CI

- **`npx voidforge-build init` now copies `.claude/workflows/`** (+ `AGENT_CLASSIFICATION.md`). gauntlet.md/assemble.md referenced workflow scripts that the CLI init path never shipped — v23.18.0 only patched the prepack/dist paths, not `project-init.ts`.
- **`npx voidforge-build update` now propagates `.claude/workflows` + `scripts/surfer-gate`** — both were absent from the updater's diff list, so existing projects never received workflow or gate fixes.
- **`publish.yml`:** `recover-partial` derives the version from `package.json`, not `github.ref_name` (a branch name on `workflow_dispatch`, which mis-targeted `npm deprecate`); the Playwright cache key keys on the committed manifests instead of the deleted-and-regenerated lockfile (was a permanent cache miss).

### Added / Changed

- **`scripts/validate-workflows.sh`** (+ `npm run validate:workflows`, wired into `pretest`): a real syntax gate for `.workflow.js` scripts. Their top-level `await`/`return` make a bare `node --check` fail ("Illegal return statement"), so the v23.18.0 "passes node --check" claim was inaccurate; the validator reproduces the runtime's async wrapper before checking, catching syntax errors before they ship.
- **`WORKFLOWS.md`** example corrected (`agentType: a.id` → `a.name`) + two new gotchas (agentType resolves by the `name:` display field; how to validate workflow scripts). Stale pre-ADR-060 `/tmp/voidforge-*` paths fixed in the gate `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md`.

### Validation

Gate suite **23 → 27** (added reap-root-preservation + pending-bypass cases). Full suite **1390 → 1392** (added init-copies-workflows + updater-tracks-workflows/gate regression tests). typecheck clean. Deferred as field-report candidates: concurrent same-repo pointer collision, `workflow_dispatch` branch guard. Dep `^23.18.0` → `^23.19.0` (ADR-062).

## [23.18.0] - 2026-06-13

### Workflow re-platform of `/gauntlet` + `/assemble` (ADR-067)

The opportunity ADR-064 unblocked. The heavy review commands' deterministic skeletons now run as Dynamic Workflows, so 60–80 agents' intermediate findings live in script variables instead of the lead's context.

### Added

- **`.claude/workflows/gauntlet.workflow.js`** — the 5-round Gauntlet as a workflow: discovery (parallel core leads) → **plain-JS dedupe** → **3-lens adversarial REFUTE** per claim (schema-validated votes, default-to-refuted, keep ≥2/3, verify-the-FIX, reproduce-through-real-path) → crossfire (adversaries hunt NEW issues) → council (JS synthesis by severity). Refuted claims logged, never silently dropped.
- **`.claude/workflows/assemble-review.workflow.js`** — the review-heavy `/assemble` phases (engage + sentinel + crossfire + council) over a mission's working diff; one run per pass so `--interactive` pauses at the boundary. Build/architecture/devops phases **stay prose orchestration**.
- **`docs/methods/WORKFLOWS.md`** — the authoring standard: when-to-use, API (`phase`/`parallel`/`pipeline`/`agent({schema})`), the `args`-as-JSON-string (#363) + label-leading-character (#348) gotchas, the 16/1000 caps (ADR-059), and the **ADR-064 gate-launch sequence** (Surfer → record-roster → Workflow). Added to the CLAUDE.md Docs Reference.
- **ADR-067** decision record.

### Changed

- **`gauntlet.md` / `assemble.md`** gain "Workflow Execution" sections: the gate-compliant launch (muster Surfer → record roster → invoke the workflow with the roster in `args`), what's workflow-backed vs prose, and the `--light`/`--solo` raw-Agent fallback. Personas, the Agent Debate Protocol, severity re-rating, and **fix application** stay lead/prose judgment (the lead applies fixes from the returned report, then re-runs to re-verify).
- **Distribution (Phase 12.75 gate):** `.claude/workflows/` is a new shared file category — added to `prepack.sh` (npm package) and `copy-assets.sh` (CLI `init`) so the scripts reach consumers (they were referenced by the command docs but would not have shipped otherwise — the #297 class).

### Validation

Both workflow scripts pass `node --check` (ESM, async-wrapped to match the Workflow runtime). The **live end-to-end gauntlet run is the acceptance test** (it launches 30+ real review agents through the now-gated Workflow path); the raw-Agent prose path remains the fallback and canonical description. Dogfooded pre-tag `npm test` (1390/1390) + publish-gate. Dep range `^23.17.0` → `^23.18.0` (ADR-062).

---

## [23.17.0] - 2026-06-13

### Effort-tiering fleet edit (ADR-054) — verified + applied

Closes the M2 deferral from v23.16.0.

### Verified

- Confirmed against the **official Claude Code sub-agents docs** that `effort` is a supported sub-agent frontmatter field — values `low`/`medium`/`high`/`xhigh`/`max`, "available levels depend on the model" (so Haiku is omitted). It is a recognized key (the docs enumerate the full frontmatter set including `effort`), so adding it cannot break agent loading — the safety concern that justified deferring the fleet edit.

### Changed

- **All 264 agent definitions** now carry an `effort` tier (frontmatter-only, inserted after `model:`): **20 leads (`model: inherit`) → `effort: xhigh`**, **201 Sonnet specialists → `effort: medium`**, **43 Haiku scouts → omitted**. This is a per-agent reasoning-spend lever independent of model tier — the largest cost lever in the fleet, since ~200 read-and-report specialists no longer run at lead-level reasoning. Idempotent insert; `validate-agent-refs` + full suite **1390/1390** green; frontmatter integrity preserved. (Agent files ship in the methodology package via prepack, so the tiers reach consumers automatically.)
- Updated **ADR-054** (status → fleet-applied + verification record), **SUB_AGENTS.md** Model Tiering, **COMPATIBILITY.md** effort row (verify-pending → applied).

### Pipeline

Dogfooded pre-tag `npm test` + publish-gate alignment. Notably the v23.16.0 gate fix was confirmed **live in production this session** — a Workflow launch was correctly BLOCKED until a documented `--light` bypass was set (a reap-vs-fresh-bypass timing race was observed and noted for a future field report). Dep range `^23.16.0` → `^23.17.0` (ADR-062).

---

## [23.16.0] - 2026-06-13

### Platform-alignment campaign — ADR-064/065/066 implemented (+ ADR-050/051/054 amended)

Built the ADR set designed in the `/architect --plan` review (→ `/campaign`). Dependency-ordered: the gate↔Workflow fix is the P0 precondition for any future Workflow re-platforming.

### Added

- **`docs/NATIVE_CAPABILITIES.md` (ADR-066)** — the native-capability collision tracker ADR-050 deferred and never created. Audits every `.claude/commands/*.md` against the mid-2026 native skill set with a recorded disposition each: `/engage`/`/sentinel` (rename+alias, done in ADR-050), `/qa` + `/test` (**coexist + document** — project-local CLI resolution wins; web/IDE users invoke the gated flow explicitly; rename deferred as too disruptive), `/git` (**keep** — native `/commit` is narrower than Coulson's release management), all others **keep**. Re-audit gate added to the release checklist.
- **ADR-064 / ADR-065 / ADR-066** decision records; `docs/COMPATIBILITY.md` Claude Code platform-floor + per-feature maturity table (ADR-065).

### Changed

- **Silver Surfer gate now covers the Workflow tool (ADR-064).** `.claude/settings.json` matcher `"Agent"` → `"Agent|Workflow"`; `scripts/surfer-gate/check.sh` gates a Workflow launch on a recorded roster (Workflow `tool_input` has no `subagent_type`, so the Surfer-self rule simply doesn't match it). `scripts/surfer-gate/test.sh` gains 3 Workflow cases (no-roster→block, roster→allow, bypass→allow) — suite **23/23**; mirrored to `packages/methodology/scripts/surfer-gate/`. **Behavior change:** a Workflow run now requires a recorded roster or a `--light`/`--solo` bypass — closes the empirically-proven bypass (this session: 60+ workflow agents → 0 gate events). CLAUDE.md gate section updated.
- **`packages/methodology/package.json`** — informational `claudeCodeFloor` field (ADR-065; not npm-enforced; conservative baseline pending operator confirmation).
- **Amended ADRs:** ADR-051 (documents the Agent-tool-scoping limitation + ADR-064 closure), ADR-054 (effort tiers + Haiku 4.5 200K/no-`effort` constraints), ADR-050 (status → Accepted; tracker realized).

### Deferred

- **ADR-054 effort fleet edit** (264-agent frontmatter `effort:`) — the *policy* shipped in v23.15.0 (SUB_AGENTS.md + flag mapping); the fleet edit waits on runtime verification that agent-frontmatter `effort:` is honored (ADR-054 precondition), to avoid breaking agent loading with an unverified key.
- **`/gauntlet` / `/assemble` Workflow re-platforming** — the opportunity ADR-064 *unblocks*, but a larger build than this ADR set; flagged for a future campaign.

### Pipeline

Dogfooded pre-tag `npm test` + the publish-gate alignment. The gate fix is itself dogfooded — the Fixture-Bindability test (`Workflow launch, no roster → exit 2`) returned `exit 0` before the change and `exit 2` after. Dep range `^23.15.0` → `^23.16.0` (ADR-062).

---

## [23.15.0] - 2026-06-13

### Platform alignment — gate↔Workflow (ADR-064) + model-ID/effort/concurrency currency

Output of `/architect --plan` (a 12-agent platform-evolution review of VoidForge against the mid-2026 Claude Code platform) → `/build` items **(b)** then **(a)**.

### Added

- **ADR-064 — Silver Surfer Gate ↔ Dynamic Workflow interop.** Empirically confirmed the `PreToolUse` gate (`check.sh:99`, matcher `"Agent"` only) is **structurally blind to Workflow-tool-spawned agents**: across this session ~60+ workflow agents produced exactly **2** gate events (`Surfer self-launch`, `ROSTER_RECEIVED`), and a controlled `gate-probe` workflow left the count unchanged (BEFORE=2 / AFTER=2). Decision: extend the matcher to `Agent|Workflow` and gate the workflow *launch* on a recorded roster. **Implementation is a campaign mission** (it touches the gate + its test suite); the ADR records the decision + the reproducible test.

### Fixed

- **Live runtime model-ID bug** — `packages/voidforge/wizard/lib/anthropic.ts` `resolveBestModel()` fell back to **`claude-sonnet-4-7`, a model that does not exist**, on the exact API-unreachable path the fallback exists for (→ 404 when reliability matters most). Corrected to `claude-sonnet-4-6` at both fallback sites, fixed the test that *asserted the bug* (now 6/6 green), and updated `PRD.md` / `FAILURE_MODES.md` / `AI_INTELLIGENCE.md`. (#359-adjacent; surfaced by Seldon + Troi.)
- **Stale model IDs in reference patterns** — `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` → `claude-sonnet-4-6` across 6 `docs/patterns/*.ts` (every `init` copies these); `Opus 4.7` → `Opus 4.8` across `SUB_AGENTS.md` + ADR-050/051/054/059. (Historical CHANGELOG mentions of `4-7` left intact.)

### Changed

- **Effort-tiering policy** added to `SUB_AGENTS.md` Model Tiering (leads `xhigh` / specialists `medium` / **scouts omit — Haiku 4.5 errors on `effort` and caps at 200K context**) and mapped onto the flag taxonomy in `CLAUDE.md` (default→xhigh/medium, `--fast`→medium/low, `ultracode`-keyword caveat). The 264-file frontmatter fleet edit + the ADR-054 amendment are deferred to the campaign (pending runtime verification that agent-frontmatter `effort:` is honored).
- **ADR-059 amended** with the real platform concurrency ceiling (**~16 concurrent / ~1,000 per run** — the "20+/30+ parallel" framing was context-headroom, not actual parallelism; batch unbounded fan-outs) and promoted Proposed→Accepted. **`GAUNTLET.md`** "Each round launches agents in waves of 3" (which contradicted ADR-059) corrected to full-roster-with-batching.

### Pipeline

Dogfooded the v23.13.1 pre-tag `npm test` gate and the v23.14.0 publish-gate alignment. Dep range `^23.14.0` → `^23.15.0` (ADR-062). Operator-directed follow-on this session: `/architect --plan` ADR-065 (platform version floor) + ADR-066 (native-capability collision tracker) + amend ADR-051/054 → `/campaign --plan` → `/campaign` build all non-stop.

---

## [23.14.0] - 2026-06-12

### Field Report Triage — 2 reports closed (#362, #363)

`/debrief --inbox` triaged and applied 8 accepted fixes across 9 files. #363 was self-filed the prior session (debrief of the #356–#361 triage + the v23.13.0/.1 releases); #362 is an enhancement report. The apply phase **dogfooded #363 itself** — the registry-derived fan-out coverage check (9/9 target files confirmed in `git diff`) and `npm test` (1390/1390) both ran *before* tagging.

### Added

- **`/engage --pre-deploy --diff` mode** (`.claude/commands/engage.md`) — the named, right-sized pre-deploy review gate: scopes review to the working-tree diff (`git diff HEAD`), auto-sizes the lens panel to change size (~2 for a tweak, 4–5 for schema/security), and always runs the Step 2.5 adversarial-verify pass. Not a new review engine; lighter than `/gauntlet`, tighter than full `/engage`. (#362-F1/F2)
- **`SUB_AGENTS.md` "The Pre-Deploy Review Gate"** — documents the diff-scoped N-lens + mandatory-verify gate and its sizing rubric. (#362-F1)
- **`SUB_AGENTS.md` "Registry-Derived Fan-Out: Enumerate the Tuple Set, Diff the Result"** — the apply-phase analog of the #355 glob-fan-out residual sweep: derive the work-list from the authoritative accepted-fix registry (never memory), then `git diff --name-only` against the accepted `targetFile` set; completion = "every accepted targetFile appears in the diff." (#363-F3)
- **`DEVOPS_ENGINEER.md` "Chronically-Red Check Policy"** (red ≥2 releases → fix / informational-with-tracking-issue / remove; no fourth disposition) and **"Publish gate alignment"** (the tag-push publish workflow must `needs:` the full E2E+a11y suite or gate on a same-SHA `workflow_run` — a unit-only publish gate is structurally blind to a11y regressions). (#363-F4)
- **`TESTING.md` "Numeric constant migration checklist"** — `git grep` the old literal and fix all assertions (or extract the constant) in the same commit; generalizes the error-shape rule to any value tests encode. (#363-F2)

### Changed

- **`.claude/commands/git.md` Step 5 (Verify)** — new **first** action: run the project test suite (`npm test`/`make test`/`pytest`/`cargo test`) and stop on failure *before* Step 6 Push, because tag-push arms an irreversible CI publish. (#363-F1)
- **`docs/methods/RELEASE_MANAGER.md`** — Verification Checklist gains "all CI checks green or a recorded chronically-red disposition" and "publish workflow depends on the full validation suite"; Pre-Push Lint Sweep clarified as *additive to*, not a substitute for, the test suite, plus the `gh auth refresh -s workflow` note for `.github/workflows/` pushes. (#363-F1/F4/F5)
- **`docs/methods/SUB_AGENTS.md`** — Workflow scripts must defensively parse `args` (delivered as a JSON string). (#363-F5)
- **`.claude/commands/debrief.md` Step 6** — the inbox apply block now enumerates the `(fixId,targetFile)` work-list before dispatch and runs the post-apply coverage diff-check before closing any issue. (#363-F3)
- **`docs/methods/QA_ENGINEER.md` + `PRODUCT_DESIGN_FRONTEND.md`** — atomic-visual render-harness screenshot carve-out: a component-in-isolation screenshot satisfies the "verify visually" rule for a single component/icon/loader/state, without standing up the full authed app (scoped to atomic artifacts; layout/flow still gets the full-page pass). (#362-F3)

### Pipeline

Cut via a 9-agent per-file applier workflow. Dep range `^23.13.1` → `^23.14.0` (ADR-062). Note for a follow-up: this repo's own `publish.yml` does not yet satisfy the new Publish-gate-alignment rule (it `needs: [test]` only; the e2e/a11y job lives in `validate-branches.yml`) — wiring that dependency is a `.github/workflows/` change (needs the `workflow` token scope) tracked separately.

---

## [23.13.1] - 2026-06-12

### Publish-gate fix for v23.13.0 (stale surfer-gate test)

v23.13.0 was committed, tagged, and pushed but **never published to npm** — the `Publish to npm` workflow's `test` stage failed before any publish job ran (npm stayed at 23.12.2; no partial release).

Cause: the #360 roster-TTL change raised `ROSTER_TTL_SECONDS` 600 → 3600 in `scripts/surfer-gate/check.sh`, but the gate's own `test.sh` "Stale roster (>10min) blocks" case ages a roster **11 minutes** and asserts a block (exit 2). Under the new 1-hour TTL an 11-minute-old roster is still *fresh*, so the gate correctly returned exit 0 — and the test (asserting 2) failed, tripping the CI `pretest` gate.

### Fixed

- **`scripts/surfer-gate/test.sh`** (+ tracked `packages/methodology/` mirror) — age the stale-roster test fixture to **61 minutes** (past the new 3600s TTL) and relabel the case ">1hr". Gate suite back to 20/20; full workspace suite 1390/1390. No behavior change beyond v23.13.0.

### Lesson

A threshold/TTL change in a gate script must update that gate's adversarial test **in the same commit** — the stale-roster assertion is exactly the threshold-coupled test that #356-F4 (reproduce through the real path) and #358-F1 (composition gaps) warn about. Dep range `^23.13.0` → `^23.13.1` (ADR-062).

## [23.13.0] - 2026-06-12

### Field Report Triage — 6 reports closed (#356–#361)

`/debrief --inbox` triaged all six open field reports against the post-v23.12.2 tree via two-phase workflow orchestration — per-report investigators classified each proposed fix (accept / already-fixed / wontfix / needs-info) with file-quoted evidence, an adversarial pass independently re-verified every `already-fixed` verdict, then per-file appliers landed the accepted edits. 25 proposed fixes → **23 accepted, 1 already-fixed (verified), 1 wontfix**. Applied across 17 files + 1 new pattern. Five clusters:

- **Deploy safety** — the empty-string-into-strict-Zod boot-crash trap (`${VAR:-}` → `""` defeats `z.string().url().optional()` because `.optional()` only admits `undefined`; fix is `z.preprocess('' → undefined)` ahead of the strict check), "render is not load" (`docker compose config` resolves env but never runs the app's config validator — verify config LOADS), canary-the-worker-first on config-affecting changes, pre-build disk preflight (prune cache + stale SHA tags, keep the rollback tag), and OAuth post-deploy IdP-side-vs-regression discrimination (don't reflexively roll back on an IdP-domain error — retry incognito). (#356, #357)
- **Adversarial-verify rigor** — a CONFIRM backed by "I reproduced it" counts only when reproduced through the REAL execution path (the actual CLI/tool/runtime), not the underlying library in isolation (#356); the Victory Gauntlet MUST include a composition/wiring lens over the assembled entry paths (per-mission reviews are structurally blind to cross-mission composition), and a conditional "safe to ship gated-off but not to arm" verdict requires a ship-vs-enable ADR + prerequisites runbook before sign-off (#358).
- **Mandatory verification** — prompt evals run INLINE via the secret-injected runner (`npm run eval:op`), not deferred to the operator (#359); the adversarial security review is REQUIRED (not author-discretionary) for any change adding an untrusted-data → user-facing-sink path (#359); live-fire every external credential against its provider before marking it done — env-var-set ≠ done (#360); and verify a mission brief's premise against the code before scoping the fix (#360).
- **Secret surfaces** — git remote / `.git/config` inline-credential scan added to Kenobi/Leia Phase 1, the deploy-preflight pattern, and DEVOPS deploy-safety rules; a live PAT in an HTTPS remote URL was invisible to every prior secrets check. (#361)
- **Test fidelity** — real-output seeded-mutant self-test (does-it-fix / does-no-harm) mandated for any LLM/external-output boundary; "if every test of an integration boundary uses a fixture you authored, you have not tested the boundary." (#358)

### Added

- **`docs/patterns/codemod-hygiene.md`** (52nd pattern) — after a jscodeshift/recast/`@next/codemod` run, strip incidental reformatting (recast re-prints touched nodes) so the diff shows only the semantic change. Registered in `docs/patterns/README.md` and the CLAUDE.md Code Patterns list. (#357)

### Changed

- **`docs/methods/DEVOPS_ENGINEER.md`** — Config Foot-Guns 4th trap (strict-validated optional env boot-crash + `z.preprocess` fix); "render is not load" compose sub-bullet (count Two→Three); Pre-Build Disk Preflight subsection; live-fire-per-credential and OAuth-IdP-side deploy-safety rules. (#356, #357, #360)
- **`.claude/commands/deploy.md`** — Step 2 pre-deploy items: config-loads check (#356) + mandatory untrusted→sink review (#359); new Step 2.6 disk preflight (#357) and Step 2.7 prompt-eval gate (#359); canary-worker-first in Step 3, Step 3.5 pre-prod verification strategy (#357), Step 5 rollback IdP-side preamble (#357).
- **`docs/methods/GAUNTLET.md`** — reproduce-through-real-execution-path verify rule (#356); composition/wiring lens + ship-vs-enable conditional-verdict requirement (#358).
- **`docs/methods/CAMPAIGN.md` + `.claude/commands/campaign.md`** — premise-verification sub-step (#360); pre-prod-verification-when-no-staging branch + dependency-feasibility-first reference (#357); Victory Gauntlet composition-lens cross-reference (#358).
- **`docs/methods/SECURITY_AUDITOR.md`** — Phase-1 git-remote credential scan (#361); mandatory untrusted-data→user-facing-sink adversarial-review trigger (#359).
- **`docs/methods/QA_ENGINEER.md` + `docs/methods/TESTING.md`** — real-output seeded-mutant self-test for LLM/external-output boundaries (#358); seed-draft + `?draft=<id>` deep-link screenshot technique when the worker pipeline is down (#359).
- **`docs/methods/AI_INTELLIGENCE.md`** — the LIVE eval is run by the agent in-session via the secret-injected `eval:op` runner, never deferred to the operator (LIVE-eval-gate subsection + Operating Rule 5) (#359); **`docs/methods/SYSTEMS_ARCHITECT.md`** — Dependency-Feasibility-First migration gate (#357).
- **`docs/patterns/ai-prompt-safety.ts`** — lenient-schema + sanitize-at-trusted-boundary pattern for untrusted extraction fields (#359); **`docs/patterns/deploy-preflight.ts`** — opt-in `.git/config` inline-credential scan, never prints the matched secret (#361).
- **Agents** — `lucius-config.md` (strict-validator-on-optional-env learning, #356) and `leia-secrets.md` (`.git/config` remote-URL secret learning, #361) Operational Learnings.
- **`scripts/surfer-gate/check.sh` + `docs/adrs/ADR-060`** — roster TTL 600s → 3600s with mtime refresh-on-activity, so long real-code missions don't force redundant Surfer re-scans mid-mission. (#360)

### Pipeline

Cut via two background workflows (investigate→verify, then per-file apply) with a full `git diff` review gate before commit. **#358-F3** (find→verify ≥2/3 adversarial-lens pattern) verified already-shipped in v23.12.0 (`SUB_AGENTS.md`) — no change. **#360-F4** (don't pin a sunsetting external-API version without a health check) reporter-scoped to project LEARNINGS; its kernel is folded into the #360 live-fire-per-credential rule. Dep range `^23.12.2` → `^23.13.0` (ADR-062). Tracked generated copies re-synced: `packages/methodology/CLAUDE.md` (ADR-058 strip) and `packages/methodology/scripts/surfer-gate/check.sh`.

## [23.12.2] - 2026-06-09

### `/git` monorepo release-discipline fix

A review of `/git` after the v23.12.0/.1 releases found that its version-*bump* steps (3–5) still assumed a single `package.json` — even though its *publish* step (7) was already monorepo-aware. On this two-package monorepo that meant `/git` would have bumped only one (nonexistent root) `package.json` and missed both workspace packages and the ADR-062 dep pin — exactly the three things bumped by hand in v23.12.0 and v23.12.1. Same doc↔reality drift class as #320/#342.

### Changed

- **`.claude/commands/git.md` Step 3** — bump **every** versioned `package.json` (names both `packages/voidforge` and `packages/methodology`; notes the root is `"private"` with no version), **bump the internal dep pin** `voidforge-build-methodology` → `^<new-version>` (ADR-062), and **re-sync tracked generated copies** (`packages/methodology/CLAUDE.md` via the ADR-058 `sed` strip). Steps 4 (staging) and 5 (verify) updated to check all workspace packages + the pin + the generated copy.
- **`docs/methods/RELEASE_MANAGER.md` `/git --npm` section** — added two troubleshooting rules learned this session:
  - **`npm error E404` on publish = account/scope, not expiry.** npm returns 404 (not 403) on publish to hide package existence, so E404 means the credential lacks write access to *that package* — wrong-account token, unscoped/read-only granular token, or wrong registry. Check `npm owner ls <pkg>` and verify the token's account (`npm whoami --userconfig`) *before* rotating. In CI the local preflight doesn't run, so an E404 points at the `NPM_TOKEN` secret's account. (Cites the incident where a v23.12.x publish failed E404 four times on a token minted from a non-owner account.)
  - **Sequential oldest-first publish** when catching up multiple unpublished versions, so the `latest` dist-tag lands on the newest semver rather than whichever CI run finished last.

### Pipeline

First release cut via the corrected `/git` procedure (dogfood) — both packages and the dep pin bumped together. Dep range `^23.12.1` → `^23.12.2` (ADR-062).

## [23.12.1] - 2026-06-09

### Follow-on triage — #354/#355 (8 fixes) + chronic CI-check fix

`#354` and `#355` were filed *during* the v23.12.0 run, so a second `/debrief --inbox` triaged them against the post-v23.12.0 tree. The adversarial verify pass overturned one false "already-fixed" (#355 F4); `#355 F5` was confirmed already-shipped (derived-counts doctrine). 8 fixes applied across 15 files.

### Changed

- **REFUTE lens reaches `/engage` + `/sentinel`** (#354 F1) — v23.12.0 added the vote-based adversarial REFUTE pass (skeptics told to refute, ≥1 CONFIRM to keep, re-rate from votes) to `/gauntlet` + `/assemble`, but `/engage` and `/sentinel` still used the older "second agent disagrees → drop" model. Ported as `/engage` Step 2.5 and a `/sentinel` Phase 3 gate; named find→cluster→3-lens-verify as the default review shape in `SUB_AGENTS.md`.
- **Enforcement-keyed severity rubric** (#354 F2) — severity keys to the enforcement *layer*, not the symptom location: a client affordance leak the server still enforces (render-then-403) is UX-only (P2/P3), not a breach. "Where is this actually enforced?" added to the audit + verify lens. → `SECURITY_AUDITOR.md`, `PRODUCT_DESIGN_FRONTEND.md`, `/ux`, `/sentinel`.
- **"Isolation-green ≠ deploy-green"** (#354 F3) — targeted/isolation test runs are necessary but not sufficient; only the full suite is the deploy gate (environment coupling regresses unrelated tests invisibly to isolation runs). → `BUILD_PROTOCOL.md`, `/deploy`, `QA_ENGINEER.md`.
- **Boot-time DDL-ownership class** (#354 F4) — startup schema re-application can fail on tables owned by a different DB role than the app connects as; the other two deploy-env classes it named (served-artifact, `.env` precedence) were already covered by v23.12.0/prior. → `DEVOPS_ENGINEER.md`, `database-migration.ts`.
- **Contrast findings must cite source hex** (#355 F1) — a contrast finding must quote the literal source hex for *both* fg and bg with `file:line`, and re-grep that the class pairing exists, before being rated Critical; token NAMES are not proxies for VALUES (a token called "paper" may be near-black). Defends against the token-name-swap false site-wide Critical. → `PRODUCT_DESIGN_FRONTEND.md`, `GAUNTLET.md`, `samwise-accessibility.md`.
- **Glob-derived fan-out work-lists** (#355 F2) — derive per-agent file lists for a directory/migration fan-out from a glob, never a hand-typed list, and pair every fan-out with a mandatory post-fan-out completeness sweep before the wave is "done"; an "unsampled"/"not-checked" flag is coverage debt to carry forward. → `CAMPAIGN.md`, `SUB_AGENTS.md`, `silver-surfer-herald.md`.
- **Focused single-lens roster sizing** (#355 F3) — when `--focus` names one lens, cap the roster ~6–8 and partition agents by surface, not by near-duplicate persona. → `silver-surfer-herald.md`, `/ux`, `GAUNTLET.md`.
- **Per-wave staging deploy = status checkpoint** (#355 F4) — inlined in `CAMPAIGN.md` Step 4/5 action prose (the anti-pattern callout existed; the inline action-prose statement did not — caught by the verify pass).
- **Fixed the chronically-red `validate-branches.yml` slash-command check** — its `grep '| \`/[a-z]'` matched the Docs-Reference table's `/docs/*.md` rows and the `sed` mangled them into bogus `MISSING` paths, failing the job on every release since v23.11.0. Now anchored to bare `/command` cells (letters/hyphens, closing backtick) so `/docs/...` and `/HOLOCRON.md` are excluded. This is itself the #352 "gate that doesn't gate" class. (Note: the workflow's separate `e2e-tests` job still fails on a pre-existing wizard `aria-required-children` a11y issue — unrelated to methodology.)
- **Registered `/audit-docs`** in the CLAUDE.md Slash Commands table (shipped as a command in v23.12.0 but not listed). Synced to `packages/methodology/CLAUDE.md`.
- **`packages/voidforge/package.json`** methodology dep range `^23.12.0` → `^23.12.1` (ADR-062).

### Closes

- **#354**, **#355**. #355 F5 already shipped (derived-counts doctrine); no out-of-scope items.

### Field Report Triage — 12 reports closed (#342–#353), 58 fixes + 5 new files

The v23.12 methodology pass. `/debrief --inbox` triaged all 12 open field reports against the live codebase, then applied every accepted fix in one session via two-phase workflow orchestration: a **triage** pass (one agent per report, each grepping the codebase to separate already-shipped from open), followed by an **apply** pass (one writer agent per target file — disjoint files, no conflicts) with an **adversarial verify** agent re-reading every file. Two reports' fixes were found already-shipped and adversarially confirmed (#349 F-4, #352 #3); four proposed fixes were out of scope (Claude Code core / harness skill / Workflow tool) and left to upstream. 58 fixes landed across 32 files plus 5 new files.

The reports corroborated each other into 7 clusters:

### Added

- **`docs/patterns/design-tokens.ts`** — semantic color/type token layer (one indirection) so a palette/type pivot is a token edit, not a component-wide rewrite (#351).
- **`docs/patterns/nginx-vhost.conf`** — Cloudflare-Flexible-safe vhost template: security-header stack, ACME http-01 passthrough, no origin redirect loop behind CF Flexible SSL, `limit_req_zone` http-context comment (#344 F2/F4a).
- **`docs/patterns/error-message-categorization.tsx`** — categorize errors at the UI boundary (network / auth / validation / server / quota / unknown) before choosing copy, so a billing error never renders "try a different file" (#343 F8).
- **`.claude/commands/audit-docs.md`** + **`docs/methods/DOC_AUDIT.md`** — a Surfer-led doc-audit path (Troi / Wong / Irulan / Coulson) for currency, cross-reference, and command↔method sync, so doc audits stop being mis-routed through `/ux` (#342 F-3).
- **`scripts/regen-claude-md.sh`** — idempotent regenerator for a marker-delimited generated CLAUDE.md block from a truth source (`docs/_truth.yml` / `package.json` + git), exits cleanly when no truth source is present (#342 F-2).
- Pattern library 48 → 51.

### Changed

- **Verify the FIX, not just the finding** (#348, #349 F-2, #350 #4) — `SUB_AGENTS.md`, `GAUNTLET.md`, and `/engage` now require the adversarial pass to interrogate the *proposed fix* for new failure modes (wedge / unbounded retry / loop / orphan / double-send), especially when it adds a coordination primitive (sentinel/lock/retry-state) without a liveness signal. Anchored to the M5 mint-fence incident (a reclaim window unreachable inside the retry budget wedged drafts in FAILED). `/engage` also now names the governing SSOT and reconciles fix direction (loosen/tighten) before a finding is actionable.
- **Production-config gate** (#350) — `GAUNTLET.md` gains an `APP_ENV=production` boot-assertion exit criterion plus a sandbox-blind-spot round ("what does the green sandbox suite NOT exercise?"); `CAMPAIGN.md` Victory Checklist now requires a prod-config boot before declaring victory. Sandbox-green is necessary, not sufficient.
- **Spring Cleaning consumer-vs-clone** (#343 F10, destructive-risk) — `FORGE_KEEPER.md` Step 1.5 now distinguishes methodology *consumers* (app projects — skip the always-remove list, fingerprint defensively) from *clones* (apply the migration registry), with a `package.json`-deps detection heuristic, so an app project no longer loses `tsconfig.json` / lockfiles / test configs.
- **Silver Surfer roster sizing** (#343 F6, #344 F5, #346 #1, #345 DEAL-001) — `silver-surfer-herald.md` gains `scope_bias` (lean roster when explicit file/dir scope is given), `scope_density` (6–10 for small single-shot surfaces), a ~18 single-mission cap with core/advisory tiering, and a basename-normalization rule; the corrected Output Format example now shows real basenames.
- **Creative/UX grounding** (#347, #351) — `/ux` gains a mandatory World-Scan / Reference-Grounding step (award galleries + live competitors → reference dossier), a prototype-to-feel step, and a de-AI checklist gate; `PRODUCT_DESIGN_FRONTEND.md` documents the committee-converges-on-the-mean failure mode, token-scoped theming, and show-don't-tell; Galadriel gains matching learnings; `/architect` and `/imagine` apply world-scan when design is in scope; the Surfer must add a web-capable scout to creative rosters (design agents have no web access).
- **Deploy / DevOps foot-guns** (#344, #349 F-1, #352, #353) — `DEVOPS_ENGINEER.md` gains 13 entries: no `eval`-export `.env` parsing (mangles `$`-bearing secrets), no `MemoryDenyWriteExecute` on Node systemd units (V8 JIT SIGTRAP), Cloudflare-Flexible redirect-loop + token-scope, served-artifact-≠-built-artifact deploy verification, worktree directory-rename pointer fragility, per-user git ident, blue-green nomenclature check, `pm2 reload` log-path binding, `docker compose up --dry-run` topology + merge semantics, config foot-guns, Docker-cleanup ownership preflight, read-back-after-vendor-PUT. Mirrored as learnings on Kusanagi and Lucius; `deploy-preflight.ts` and `daemon-process.ts` gain the matching checks/stanzas; `/deploy` gains a served-artifact fingerprint step.
- **Doc-currency & QA gates** (#342, #346, #349 F-3, #352 #1) — `CAMPAIGN.md` + `ASSEMBLER.md` gain a pre-SEAL Doc-Currency Refresh (Coulson + Wong) with `--no-doc-refresh`, an execution-time cluster sub-split, and integrated-changeset per-mission review; `RELEASE_MANAGER.md` retires the auto-rotting PROJECT_VERSION footer; `GAUNTLET.md` + `/assemble` + `/gauntlet` formalize a vote-based adversarial REFUTE sub-step and critical-always-verified routing (also in `/assess` Blueprint Mode); `QA_ENGINEER.md` gains a planted-bug "gates must gate" check and a stash-compare failure-attribution rule; `AI_INTELLIGENCE.md` adds the live-eval pre-launch gate + null-optional normalization gotcha.
- **CLAUDE.md** — Personality gains "Apply findings, don't offer a picker" (#343 F5) and "Honor authorized autonomy with single-question gates" (#344 G1); the Silver Surfer Gate documents when it fires (review phase, not solo build — #348) and a roster-name normalization step in the Orchestrator contract (#345). Synced to `packages/methodology/CLAUDE.md`.
- **`packages/voidforge/package.json`** methodology dep range `^23.11.4` → `^23.12.0` (ADR-062).

### Closes

- **#342–#353** (12 field reports). Every accepted fix applied and adversarially verified. #349 F-4 (`/git` PROJECT_VERSION SSOT) and #352 #3 (find→adversarially-verify default) were already shipped — confirmed, not re-implemented. Out of scope and left upstream: #345 DEAL-004 (Workflow-tool args coercion), #353 RC-001/RC-002 + the `/update-config` callout (Claude Code core / harness skill — VoidForge cannot patch what it does not ship).

### Pipeline

This release was produced by `/debrief --inbox` run as two background workflows: a 14-agent triage pass and a 73-agent apply+verify pass (one writer per file over a disjoint partition, so 37 files were edited concurrently without conflict). The lone collision (a duplicated patterns-README row from two agents both registering the same new pattern) was caught by the verify pass and corrected. Method-doc and pattern edits propagate to the npm methodology package via `prepack.sh`; `packages/methodology/CLAUDE.md` (the one tracked source copy) was re-synced with the ADR-058 strip transform.

---

## [23.11.4] - 2026-05-12

### Wong promotion cluster + #260 closeout

After v23.11.3 shipped, a fresh `/debrief --inbox` re-triage on all 9 open field reports produced 3 promotion-ready clusters (each backed by 3+ data points across different reports / different projects / different operators) plus the deferred remainder of #260.

### Added

- **`docs/patterns/autonomous-ops-triage-policy.md`** (pattern #48) — codifies the 4-bucket model (self-resolving / runbook-safe / operator-approval-required / hard-never) for ops-flavored projects (infrastructure repos, monitoring daemons, homelab automation). Two operators independently reinvented this exact model across three projects (#337 F3, #336 F7, #334 F5). Pattern includes SessionStart hook visibility rule (the hook output is context-only — assistant must `echo` it back to the operator to confirm the policy is live), JSON Lines log format, decision tree, and adoption checklist.
- **CLAUDE.md Code Patterns table** — new row for `autonomous-ops-triage-policy.md` in both root and `packages/methodology/CLAUDE.md`.

### Changed

- **`docs/methods/BUILD_PROTOCOL.md` Principles #11 — Derived counts discipline.** Any user-facing numeric claim ("141+ pages", "Gated pages: 19", "6 missions completed", "1390 tests") must be derived from source truth at build time OR explicitly marked with `<!-- last-verified: YYYY-MM-DD -->` and tracked in the RELEASE_MANAGER Verification Checklist. No unverified scalar claims ship. Three independent projects (#336 F6, #334 F6, #332 hidden #5) drifted the same class — this is the scalar equivalent of the No Stubs doctrine.
- **`docs/methods/CAMPAIGN.md` Planning Mode — Scope-adversary check for bug classes.** New Step 4 in `--plan` mode: when a mission documents a specific bug class, dispatch a verification agent (Riker, Feyd-Rautha, or Spock) with the explicit prompt "list all other surfaces this class touches that were NOT in the mission scope." voidforge-marketing-site (#332) deployed with a known bug class on two surfaces because the plan was scoped to one. #338 #2 independently demonstrated the same need.
- **`docs/methods/PRODUCT_DESIGN_FRONTEND.md` Operating Rule #12 — Tutorial-context checklist for slash commands.** Standalone `/<command>` references in tutorial content must establish "inside Claude Code" context (preceding `claude` block, callout box, or contextual prose). First-touch user content with missing launch context is a Critical UX defect. Galadriel's Step 1.5 Usability Review now explicitly flags this. (#260 remainder.)
- **`docs/methods/QA_ENGINEER.md` Operating Rule #13 — Tutorial smoke test for slash commands.** Batman's QA pass on tutorial/onboarding docs runs a grep-based check: every `/<command>` mention must have launch context within 5 lines or a callout block on the same page. Sister-rule to PRODUCT_DESIGN_FRONTEND.md #12. (#260 remainder.)
- **`packages/voidforge/package.json`** methodology dep range `^23.11.3` → `^23.11.4` per ADR-062 discipline (always pin methodology dep to current version on every release).

### Closes

- **#260** — HOLOCRON preamble shipped in v23.11.3; PRODUCT_DESIGN_FRONTEND.md + QA_ENGINEER.md tutorial checklist proposals now ship in v23.11.4. Fully addressed.

### Pipeline

This release is the first Wong promotion-cluster pass executed end-to-end in one session: `/debrief --inbox` triaged all 9 field reports, identified the 3 ready-now clusters, and promoted them directly into method docs and pattern library. 11 field reports remain open as v23.12 methodology campaign scope (7 priority clusters identified by Bashir: security & declaration discipline, database migration patterns, PRD/release sync, architect protocol, build/CI gates, Plex pattern bundle, container/infra patterns).

## [23.11.3] - 2026-05-12

### Issue #331 destructive-bug fix + HIGH CVE patch + dep contract pin + CI hardening

Three-phase pipeline output: `/architect --plan` → `/debrief --inbox` → `/campaign`. 12 fix missions + 2 ADRs + 1 LEARNINGS entry + 2 mechanical guards landed in one release.

### Security

- **HIGH CVE patch** — `npm audit fix --omit=dev` resolved three vulnerabilities (2 HIGH, 1 MODERATE) in `fast-xml-parser` (≤5.6.0) and `fast-xml-builder` (≤1.1.6), pulled transitively via `@aws-sdk/xml-builder` through `@aws-sdk/client-ec2`, `client-rds`, `client-s3`, `client-elasticache`, `client-sts`. No SDK major bump required; lockfile-only change. AWS provisioner API surface unaffected.

### Fixed

- **Issue #331 — `npx voidforge-build update` silently overwrote `~/CLAUDE.md` and 44 other methodology files in `$HOME`** when run outside a VoidForge project. Root cause: `findProjectRoot()` in `packages/voidforge/wizard/lib/marker.ts` had no `$HOME` boundary, and its `existsSync()` check could not distinguish the `.voidforge` file marker from the `~/.voidforge/` state directory (ADR-060). Fix: added `statSync().isFile()` guard and `$HOME` walk break. The function now returns null/undefined when no project root is found, never `$HOME` or `/`. Codified as ADR-063 and FORGE_KEEPER Rule #11. New integration test `no-home-writes.integration.test.ts` mechanically enforces "no escape writes" by spawning the built CLI against a temp HOME and asserting zero methodology files leak out of a project boundary.
- **Issue #260 — new users tried slash commands at their shell prompt and saw "command not found"** because no doc told them to launch Claude Code first. HOLOCRON Quick Start now opens with "Before any slash command: launch Claude Code" instructions before the install snippets.
- **Issue #333 (partial — npm-prefix only)** — `npm install -g voidforge-build` failing with `EACCES` on `/usr/local` is a fragile-globals problem, not a VoidForge bug, but worth a documented workaround. HOLOCRON now shows the `npm config set prefix ~/.npm-global` recipe.

### Changed

- **Dep contract pin (ADR-062)** — `voidforge-build`'s `voidforge-build-methodology` dependency range changed from `"*"` to `"^23.11.3"`. The wildcard was live on the registry in v23.11.1 and v23.11.2, allowing any future breaking methodology major to silently pair with old CLI installs. Enforced mechanically going forward by a new `check-methodology-pin.sh` script wired as `voidforge-build`'s `prepublishOnly` — `npm publish` fails closed if the methodology range is `*`, `x`, `latest`, empty, or a `>`/`>=` open-ended range.
- **`packages/methodology/package.json`** — added `"engines": { "node": ">=20.11.0 <25.0.0" }` matching the CLI's existing constraint. Advisory, not enforced, but closes the silent-divergence gap.
- **`.github/workflows/publish.yml` hardening** (three coordinated changes):
  - Post-publish `npm view` verification step appended to both publish jobs. 6 attempts × 10s = 60-second propagation window. Hard-fails the job on still-mismatch. Closes the silent "publish succeeded at API but registry never serves" failure mode (v23.11.2 deploy synthesis, Dors + Crusher both flagged it).
  - `recover-partial` job runs `if: always() && (publish-voidforge.result == 'failure') != (publish-methodology.result == 'failure')` (XOR). On half-publish, it `npm deprecate`s the orphan with a clear "do not install" message and exits 1 to fail the workflow red. `npm unpublish` is intentionally not used (72-hour lockout breaks immutability).
  - `publish-voidforge` now declares `needs: [test, publish-methodology]` (was `needs: test` only). Methodology publishes first; voidforge-build resolves its pinned `^23.11.3` methodology dep against a registry that already has it. Closes Bel Riose's parallel-publish race window.
- **`packages/voidforge/scripts/copy-assets.sh`** — `CLAUDE.md` copy now uses the same `sed` strip as `packages/methodology/scripts/prepack.sh` (ADR-058 `<!-- REMOVE-FOR-NPM-PUBLISH ... -->` markers). Closes the inconsistency Rhodes flagged in v23.11.2 deploy synthesis where `voidforge-build`'s bundled scaffold shipped the unstripped template Project block.
- **`docs/methods/RELEASE_MANAGER.md` Verification Checklist** — two new lines: "ROADMAP.md Current line matches VERSION.md" and "monorepo CLI's methodology dep range is `^<current-version>`, never `*` (ADR-062)". Mechanical drift like the 24-version ROADMAP gap should fail the checklist, not slip silently.
- **`ROADMAP.md`** — Current pointer bumped from `v23.8.11 (2026-04-12)` to `v23.11.3 (2026-05-12)`. Status block rewritten to reflect the v23.11 series shipped.

### Added

- **ADR-062 — Always pin methodology dep to current version.** Mandates that every `voidforge-build` release bumps the `voidforge-build-methodology` dep range to `^<current-version>`. Enforced via `check-methodology-pin.sh` + prepublishOnly + a CI lint that can be added later.
- **ADR-063 — Never write to `$HOME`.** Any code path that resolves a project root via directory-walk MUST enforce a `$HOME` boundary. Enforced via `no-home-writes.integration.test.ts` running the CLI against a temp HOME.
- **`docs/LEARNINGS.md` entry** — generalizable lesson: any directory-tree walker must define a sentinel boundary (typically `$HOME` or `/`) or risk destructive past-root writes.
- **FORGE_KEEPER Rule #11** — "NEVER write to `$HOME` itself" (companion to Rule #10's "NEVER write to `~/.claude/`"). Codifies ADR-063 for Bombadil's sync logic.
- **Mechanical guards** — `check-methodology-pin.sh` (pin lint) and `no-home-writes.integration.test.ts` (boundary test). Per Frieren's planning recommendation: disciplines with silent-failure modes get mechanical enforcement; advisory disciplines (ROADMAP sync, partial-publish recovery procedure) stay documented.

### Pipeline

This release is the first multi-phase pipeline executed end-to-end in a single session: `/architect --plan` (17 agents) → `/debrief --inbox` triage (Bashir, 13 open issues categorized) → `/campaign --plan` (16 planning agents merged Phase 1 + Phase 2 into 12 missions across 4 waves) → `/campaign` execution (18 specialist agents). Honest dissents from Faramir ("cut to 6") and Erwin ("split to 2 in v23.11.3, rest in v23.11.4") were surfaced; user selected the full scope. The destructive bug fix (#331) was filed one day before this release and was the highest-priority item — Picard's earlier "tightest patch" framing was correctly overridden by Bashir's triage.

## [23.11.2] - 2026-05-12

### `voidforge init` mode prompt + methodology surfer-gate distribution

Two threads of polish: the CLI now asks before launching, and the Silver Surfer gate finally ships in the methodology npm package.

### Added

- **`voidforge init` mode prompt.** With no flag, `init` now asks "Browser wizard or CLI (headless)?" instead of silently launching the browser server. Prompt appears only when stdin is a TTY.
- **`--browser` flag on `voidforge init`.** Explicit opt-in to the wizard UI — skips the prompt for users (or scripts) that want the prior default behavior.
- **Interactive headless init.** `voidforge init --headless` now prompts for project name (required), directory (defaulted to `~/Projects/<slug>`), and optional oneliner/domain/repo when `--name` is omitted in a TTY. Fully non-interactive when all flags are passed.
- **`packages/methodology/scripts/surfer-gate/`** (8 files) — the Silver Surfer PreToolUse hook scripts (`check.sh`, `record-roster.sh`, `bypass.sh`, `_paths.sh`, `validate.sh`, `test.sh`, `README.md`, `settings-snippet.json`) now ship via the `voidforge-build-methodology` npm package, closing the ADR-051 distribution gap (#317). Previously the scripts lived only at the repo root and never reached downstream projects via `npx voidforge-build update`.
- **9 pattern-table rows** in `packages/methodology/CLAUDE.md` — propagates the v23.11.0 pattern additions (adr-verification-gate, multi-tenant-property-test, multi-tenant-pool-bypass, rls-test-fixture, structural-sql-sentinel, audit-log, refactor-extraction, ai-prompt-safety, llm-state-dedup) into the methodology package copy so they reach downstream projects.

### Changed

- **Non-TTY `voidforge init` without a flag** now exits with a clear error directing the user to `--browser` or `--headless`. Previously it silently launched a wizard server into a context where no browser would ever open — a latent bug.
- **Surfer Gate orchestrator-contract bash commands** in `packages/methodology/CLAUDE.md` are now wrapped in `[ -x ... ] && ... || true` existence guards with documented fallback ("if the script does not exist, your project predates v23.10.0; pull the gate or re-run `npx voidforge-build init`"). Lets the methodology cleanly cover both pre-#317 and post-#317 projects.

### Why this exists

The init server-launch was the loudest "this CLI doesn't ask before doing things" surface in onboarding — first-run users got a server URL with no opportunity to choose CLI mode. Two flags (`--browser`, `--headless`) now span the choice; the bare command asks. Separately, the surfer-gate scripts had been documented as shipping in the methodology package since v23.11.0 changelog #317, but the scripts themselves were never copied into `packages/methodology/`. This release actually ships them.

---

## [23.11.1] - 2026-05-10

### `/git` release-discipline patch — close the silent-release gap

v23.10.0 and v23.11.0 reached `origin/main` with bumped `package.json` versions but no git tags and no npm publish. The `publish.yml` workflow fires on `v*` tag push, so without tags the release pipeline never ran — both versions sat stranded for a full release cycle until a downstream `/void` returned nothing. Coulson now tags by default and exposes `--npm` for same-session manual publishing.

### Added

- **`.claude/commands/git.md` — Step 4.5 (Tag).** Default-on. After commit, annotate HEAD with `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "<summary>"`. Skippable via `--no-tag`. Conflict detection on existing tags.
- **`.claude/commands/git.md` — Step 7 (Publish to npm).** Opt-in via `--npm`. Preflight (`npm whoami`, clean tree), discover non-private packages whose version matches the bump, confirm + publish in dependency order (methodology before voidforge-build for VoidForge specifically), verify via `npm view ... version` with one retry. Notes the `latest` dist-tag race when multiple tags are pushed in one batch.
- **`.claude/commands/git.md` — Push tags in Step 6.** Branch push now also pushes new tags, verified against `git ls-remote --tags origin`.
- **`.claude/commands/git.md` — Arguments.** `--no-tag` and `--npm` documented in the flags block; handoff note covers npm's 72h unpublish lockout.
- **`docs/methods/RELEASE_MANAGER.md` — `/git --npm` Flag section.** Mirrors the command-file spec: when CI is the canonical path, when `--npm` is the fallback, hard rules (no dirty publish, no `--force`, no `--ignore-scripts`, stop on `EPUBLISHCONFLICT`).
- **`docs/methods/RELEASE_MANAGER.md` — Verification Checklist.** Adds `git tag --list vX.Y.Z` and post-publish `npm view <name> version` checks.

### Why this exists

Field-report context lives inline in both files so the lesson survives without an external citation. Tag step is default-on because tagless release commits are invisible to `git describe`, GitHub releases, and (critically) the tag-triggered publish workflow. Publish is opt-in because broadcast actions deserve a deliberate trigger, and the CI workflow remains the canonical path when reachable.

## [23.11.0] - 2026-05-10

### Field Report Triage — 18 reports closed (#313–#320, #322–#330)

Combined two-batch triage. Batch 1 covers multi-tenant retrofit campaigns and Union Station v7.7-v7.9 closeouts (#313-#320). Batch 2 covers autonomous-mode campaigns + AI-execution agent reports from threadplex-ops, barrierwatch, and Union Station v7.10-v7.11 (#322-#330). 9 new patterns, 18+ methodology sections, operational learnings on 7 agents. No breaking changes.

### Added

**New patterns (9):**
- **`docs/patterns/adr-verification-gate.md`** — Fixture Bindability discipline. Every ADR's verification gate must include "Can the gate FAIL under this fixture?" with algebraic/empirical rationale. Reality-anchored Implementation Scope (Proposed vs Accepted vs Deferred). Sum-verification for numbered-cohort ADRs. (#313, #314, #316, #318.)
- **`docs/patterns/audit-log.ts`** — System-event NULL trap resolution: schema relaxation (NULL org_id) vs sentinel+JSONB tag. Append-only invariants. Hash-chained integrity. (#319 §6.)
- **`docs/patterns/multi-tenant-property-test.ts`** — Property-based isolation test: any orgs A,B; A's writes never appear in B's reads. (#315, #316.)
- **`docs/patterns/multi-tenant-pool-bypass.ts`** — `pre_org_resolution_scope()` ContextVar wrapper for cross-tenant lifespan/daemon code. (#318, #319.)
- **`docs/patterns/rls-test-fixture.py`** — `db_as_app` SAVEPOINT pattern defeating the SUPERUSER + BYPASSRLS=t fixture trap. (#318, #319.)
- **`docs/patterns/structural-sql-sentinel.py`** — Adversarial-test discipline for SQL regex sentinels: commuted comparisons, casts, IS NULL, coalesce coverage. (#320.)
- **`docs/patterns/refactor-extraction.md`** — 8-commit per-entity large-refactor template with IDOR matrix discipline. (#320.)
- **`docs/patterns/ai-prompt-safety.ts`** — Type A (instructions to model, statistical) vs Type B (constraints on tool, enforced); AUTHORITY-as-text caveat; SafetyStack reference shape; 3 anti-patterns. (#325, #330.)
- **`docs/patterns/llm-state-dedup.ts`** — LLM-emitted ids are display labels, not primary keys; content-hash dedup; logical-key fallback for command-string drift; lifecycle-state snapshot completeness. (#330.)

**Pattern extensions:**
- **`docs/patterns/ai-eval.ts`** — `CLAUDE_PROMPT_EVAL_CATEGORIES` template (prompt-structure invariants, sanitizer round-trip, refusal stability on Tier-3 inputs, JSON schema adherence, cost regression). Bayta's 7-test bats spec as reference. (#325.)
- **`docs/patterns/middleware.ts`** — Hot-path logging gate (fireOnce / shouldEmit token-bucket) preventing observability-pipeline DoS from naked `logger.critical()` per-request. (#319 §5.)

**New methodology sections:**
- **`docs/methods/SYSTEMS_ARCHITECT.md`** — Scope-confidence interval for callsite-counted ADRs (verifying grep with pinned `n=N` OR ±X× uncertainty); spec adversary pass before implementation; signing-path audit requirement; service-extraction test-patch checklist. (#322, #323, #324, #326, #328, #329.)
- **`docs/methods/CAMPAIGN.md`** — Closeout grep pinning (reciprocal to scope-confidence); cluster-mission recognition at plan time; pause-bias anti-pattern (autonomous mode); ROADMAP path disambiguation; pre-split blocker phase; caller-graph audit for silent-default abstractions; V710 acceptance template inheritance counter; operator decision documents (`logs/campaign-decisions-{version}.md`); LOC growth tracker per-mission. (#322, #323, #326, #327, #329.)
- **`docs/methods/SECURITY_AUDITOR.md`** — Sanitizer Bypass-Class Checklist (7 classes: case-fold, em-dash, novel marker, newline-split, char-class, encoding, length boundary). (#325.)
- **`docs/methods/QA_ENGINEER.md`** — Strict-Mode Audit Classification (no cosmetic/WARN downgrade without behavioral evidence); Telegram-bot group-chat suffix test. (#325, #330.)
- **`docs/methods/SUB_AGENTS.md`** — Intentionally Overlapping Mandates (3+ agents on same diff = high-signal convergence); Sub-Agent Review Contract (WARN/cosmetic requires unreachable proof OR real-path test); Agent Capability Matrix. (#322, #324, #330.)
- **`docs/methods/BACKEND_ENGINEER.md`** — AST Lints Are Cheap (contracts with 8+ duplicates → AST lint + baseline + `--regenerate-baseline`). (#324.)
- **`docs/methods/RELEASE_MANAGER.md`** — Per-Commit CHANGELOG Discipline (src/**, docs/adrs/**, methods/*.md commits must stage CHANGELOG); Pre-Push Lint Sweep (run all `scripts/check-*`); Post-Amend SHA Pin (detect stale state-file SHAs after `git commit --amend`). (#322, #324, #327.)
- **`docs/methods/GAUNTLET.md`** + **`.claude/commands/gauntlet.md`** — Production-Parity Exit Criterion (test backend must match production declared in PROJECT_VERSION.md; mismatch FAILS the round regardless of green tests). (#315 M3.)
- **`docs/methods/AI_INTELLIGENCE.md`** — Event-Ladder Severity Gradient (info < warning < error < fatal monotonic; climactic rung must be fatal). (#319 §4.)
- **`docs/methods/DEVOPS_ENGINEER.md`** — Production Runtime Topology Authoritative-Source (single supervisor; reconcile `systemctl status` vs `ps -ef` before deploy). (#319 §7.)
- **`docs/methods/FORGE_KEEPER.md`** — Distribution-vs-Source Drift Check (every CLAUDE.md-cited path must exist post-sync). (#317.)
- **`docs/methods/TESTING.md`** — Decreasing-Counter Test Markers (e.g., `known_pg_gap`) for tracked migrations; monotonic counter with mission ownership in campaign-state. (#316 §7.)
- **`docs/methods/TIME_VAULT.md`** — Verification Pass Before Sealing (live psql + code reads for table count, migration head, schema invariants, file paths, test counts, version numbers). (#318.)
- **`.claude/commands/git.md`** — Project-vs-methodology changelog disambiguation (PROJECT_VERSION.md vs CHANGELOG.md routing); ROADMAP.md cross-check during verification. (#320 §5, #309 Fix 4.)
- **`.claude/commands/architect.md`** — Spec-adversary pass before implementation. (#322.)
- **`.claude/commands/campaign.md`** — Pause-bias anti-pattern mirror. (#323.)

**Operational learnings (agent definitions):**

## [23.10.0] - 2026-04-20

### Field Report Triage — 6 reports closed (#303–#308)

Wave-based triage across all open field reports. 33 approved fixes applied; 5 already-shipped confirmed; 3 deferred (MONITORING.md consolidated into DEVOPS_ENGINEER.md + FORGE_KEEPER.md per Batch E decision; #306 PF-8 hook-victory note already captured in ADR-051; #308 PF-8 TerminalCommand component is downstream marketing-site work).

### Added

- **`docs/methods/SPEC_HANDOFF.md` (NEW)** — method doc formalizing cross-session implementation hand-off. Includes `verified-against-commit: <SHA>` stamping convention and nav-order requirements for new pages. Evidence: 23/26 execution rate on v23.9.x marketing-site pass (#307 F4, #308 PF-4/PF-7).
- **`docs/patterns/deploy-preflight.ts` (NEW)** — TypeScript reference implementation of pre-deploy secret + sensitive-path scan. Called from `.claude/commands/deploy.md` Step 2.5 (#305 P1-e).
- **`docs/patterns/post-deploy-probe.sh` (NEW)** — Bash reference implementation of post-deploy denylist probe. Called from Step 4.5 (#305 P1-f).
- **`docs/LEARNINGS.md`** — six new entries (8/50 → 14/50): LRN-5 `stat -f %m` non-portability, LRN-6 npm ci lockfile drift (npm#4828), LRN-7 npm org vs scope availability, LRN-8 CI workspace-scoped test bypasses root pretest, LRN-9 spec-handoff pattern, LRN-10 marketing-site scalar count drift (#308).
- **`docs/methods/FORGE_KEEPER.md`** — new `## Deployment Hygiene` section (`.cfignore`/`.vercelignore` guidance for static-host deploys); new `## Cross-Repo Scalar Sync` section (stats.json CI artifact target; manual sync fallback).
- **`docs/methods/DEVOPS_ENGINEER.md`** — new `## Deploy Surface Boundary` section (repo root ≠ deploy surface; per-platform enforcement table for Cloudflare/Vercel/Netlify/Firebase/S3). New subsections: "CI runs `npm test` at repo root" (#308 PF-5, RC-3); "Post-push live-URL fingerprint" (broken auto-deploy integration detection, #307 F3); "Methodology-exposure check" (curl denylist, #303).
- **`docs/methods/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`** — new `## Cloudflare / Wrangler Gotchas` section (`.gitignore` ignored in Direct Upload; aliased `--force` bug; Dev Mode + Purge cache eviction).
- **`docs/methods/BUILD_PROTOCOL.md`** — Phase 12 external-API live smoke-test mandate with scope clarification (custom signing/serialization only; read-only SDK clients exempt) and credentials-unavailable escape hatch (#304 Fix 2).
- **`docs/methods/SYSTEMS_ARCHITECT.md`** — npm-name availability pre-flight (ADR authoring) — mandates dual-check of registry query AND org-create form before canonicalizing a package name (#308 PF-1).
- **`docs/methods/PRD_GENERATOR.md`** + **`.claude/commands/prd.md`** — Cloudflare Pages deploy safety: `wrangler.toml` with `pages_build_output_dir`, `.cfignore`, `SECURITY.md`, `public/.well-known/security.txt`, dedicated output directory. Explicitly forbids `wrangler pages deploy .` (#305 P0-c).
- **`docs/methods/CAMPAIGN.md`** + **`.claude/commands/campaign.md`** — Step 0.5 TECH_DEBT SLA Audit: Critical+Immediate+LowEffort 48h, Critical+Immediate+HighEffort 72h, High+Immediate 7d (reasonable defaults, override per-project) (#305 P1-a). Post-Surfer format verification (#304 Fix 3b).
- **`.claude/commands/deploy.md`** — Step 2.5 Pre-Deploy Secret Scan (Leia); Step 4.5 Post-Deploy Sensitive-Path Probe (Levi) (#305 P0-a, P0-b).
- **`.claude/commands/architect.md`** — Step 4.5 Operator Sign-off on Invented Constraints (flag agent-invented thresholds/capital/safety values) (#304 Fix 1). Post-Surfer format verification.
- **`docs/adrs/ADR-050-native-claude-code-coexistence.md`** — Rename Verification Checklist appendix: 6-pattern grep table (`"/NAME"`, `` `/NAME` ``, `(/NAME)`, `→ Agent (/NAME)`, `Run /NAME`, `/NAME protocol`) plus table-cell/CHANGELOG/error-message supplementary checks (#306 PF-2, RC-9).
- **`.claude/agents/silver-surfer-herald.md`** — `## HARD CONSTRAINT — ROSTER ONLY` section (Surfer must refuse task execution even with Write/Edit/Bash tools); small-codebase scaling note (#304 Fix 3a, #303 Fix 3).
- **`.claude/agents/picard-architecture.md`** — Operational Learning: agent-invented executive constraints require operator confirmation (#304).
- **`.claude/agents/thufir-protocol-parsing.md`** — Operational Learning: "verified against SDK" requires source code, not docs (#304).
- **`.claude/agents/leia-secrets.md`** — Operational Learning: Cloudflare User vs Account API Tokens are different dashboard pages (#305 P1-c).
- **`.claude/agents/kusanagi-devops.md`** — Operational Learning: Cloudflare Pages Dev Mode + Purge Everything may not evict all cache in one pass (#305 P1-d).

### Changed

- **`docs/methods/FORGE_KEEPER.md`** — Step 4.5 preview deploy now runs `npm test` before `npm run build` (content drift from sync surfaces as test failures, not build failures) (#307 F2). Step 0 adds parallel-session commit detection (`git log --since="1 hour ago" --all`) (#307 F5). §Shared Methodology Files adds CHANGELOG.md identity check (skip if site/app versions, not methodology) (#307 F1). §Edge Cases adds two-pass scaffold-era `/void` sync note (#303 Fix 1). §Step 4 numbering fix (duplicate `5.` → `5c.`).

### Security

- **Deploy hardening end-to-end** — Motivated by field report #305 (32-day Cloudflare Pages `.env` credential leak). Structural protections: pre-deploy secret scan + sensitive-path probe, Deploy Surface Boundary invariant with per-platform enforcement, PRD_GENERATOR now emits safety configs by default, TROUBLESHOOTING documents wrangler gotchas (`.gitignore` ignored in Direct Upload). Every VoidForge-generated project that deploys to a static host inherits these protections. Methodology-exposure check (from #303) folded into the same deploy phase.

### Release notes

- No breaking changes. Strictly additive to method-doc structure, agent naming, and build-protocol phases.
- All changes are documentation/methodology; no source-code changes. Tests and gate tests unaffected.
- Downstream work deferred: `voidforge-marketing-site` `TerminalCommand` component refactor (#308 PF-8); cross-repo `stats.json` auto-sync (#308 PF-6 target-state; manual sync documented in FORGE_KEEPER.md until auto-sync lands).

---

## [23.9.2] - 2026-04-20

### CI workflow idempotency + provenance baseline

v23.9.1 was published manually from a maintainer laptop and thus ships without npm provenance attestation (OIDC is CI-only). v23.9.2 re-publishes via CI tag-push to establish provenance as the baseline for future releases, and hardens the workflow so future accidental manual-then-tag sequences are non-destructive.

### Changed
- **`.github/workflows/publish.yml`** — both publish jobs now run a `check-*` step first (`npm view <pkg>@<version>`) and set `skip=true` if the current version is already on the registry. The actual `npm publish` step runs conditionally on `skip == 'false'`. This makes the workflow idempotent: re-triggering a tag, or tagging after a manual publish, is a no-op instead of a failure.

### Release notes
- If CI fails on this tag due to NPM_TOKEN scope (SEC-002 from ADR-061 — token was issued for `thevoidforge` and may not have write access on `voidforge-build`), rotate the token per npm account → Access Tokens. Create a new Automation token with publish scope for `voidforge-build` AND `voidforge-build-methodology` AND legacy `thevoidforge` + `thevoidforge-methodology` (for any future deprecate or owner-management operations). Update GitHub repo Secret `NPM_TOKEN` and re-run the workflow.
- Provenance verification once attached: `npm view voidforge-build@23.9.2 --json | jq '.dist.attestations'` returns non-null.

### Verification
- `npm test` — 1384/1384 pass
- `bash scripts/surfer-gate/test.sh` — 20/20 pass
- Local `npm publish --dry-run -w packages/voidforge` confirms packable state.

---

## [23.9.1] - 2026-04-20

### Publish-target pivot — `voidforge-build` supersedes `@voidforge/cli`

During the attempted v23.9.0 first-publish, the `@voidforge` npm scope was unavailable (create-org rejected the name). See ADR-061 §13 for full rationale. Switched to unscoped `voidforge-build` / `voidforge-build-methodology` matching the `voidforge.build` domain.

### Changed
- **Package names (published):** `voidforge-build` + `voidforge-build-methodology`. Unscoped. Bin name stays `voidforge` — post-install UX unchanged.
- **Runtime self-upgrade paths** (`packages/voidforge/scripts/voidforge.ts`, `packages/voidforge/wizard/lib/updater.ts`) now target `voidforge-build@latest`. `npm view`, `npm install -g`, `npx ... update` all updated.
- **`require.resolve('voidforge-build-methodology/package.json')`** replaces the scoped form in `project-init.ts:60` and `updater.ts:43`.
- **Workflow `-w` selectors** updated to `-w voidforge-build` in `publish.yml`, `validate-branches.yml`, and root `package.json` scripts.
- **`.npmrc`** simplified to `provenance=true` only (scope pin removed — no scope).
- **Docs sweep** (~25 files): active install-command and package-name references swapped from `@voidforge/cli` / `@voidforge/methodology` to `voidforge-build` / `voidforge-build-methodology`. Historical references (CHANGELOG, ROADMAP, PRD-wizard-extraction, ADR-038/039) preserved.
- **`/void` command** (`.claude/commands/void.md`) gained a "Migrating from thevoidforge or @voidforge/cli" section with explicit commands.

### Added
- **ADR-061 §13 pivot amendment** documenting the scope-unavailable finding, options considered, and the `voidforge-build` decision.
- **Legacy-install migration banner** in `voidforge.ts:40-50`. Runs on every CLI invocation when `pkg.name === 'thevoidforge' || '@voidforge/cli'`, printing the uninstall + reinstall commands on stderr. Unobtrusive for normal use; visible enough to prompt migration.

### Release strategy
- **Manual publish from maintainer laptop** (authenticated as `tomatreides`). SEC-001 scope-claim no longer applicable (unscoped); SEC-002 NPM_TOKEN rotation still relevant for CI but publish itself happens locally.
- **Farewell releases** to be published after this: `thevoidforge@23.8.20` + `thevoidforge-methodology@23.8.20`. Minimal packages whose bin prints the migration banner — catches users whose self-upgrade fires on stale legacy installs.
- **npm deprecate** on legacy names follows farewell publish.

### Verification
- `npm test` — 1384/1384 pass
- `bash scripts/surfer-gate/test.sh` — 20/20 pass
- `grep -rn '@voidforge/' .` in active docs (excluding historical) — clean except for legacy-defense line in `voidforge.ts:40` and one historical reference in LEARNINGS.md LRN-4 entry (describing the prior state).

## [23.9.0] - 2026-04-20

### Campaign 42 — @voidforge scoped npm rename + methodology hardening

4-mission campaign through Silver Surfer roster (24 agents) + full Victory Gauntlet (5 rounds, 13 specialists). Thanos's verdict: "Not yet inevitable — 3 CRITICAL caught and fixed, user-action blockers explicitly documented for publish."

### Added
- **ADR-061** — npm scoped package rename. `thevoidforge` → `@voidforge/cli`, `thevoidforge-methodology` → `@voidforge/methodology`. 12-section decision doc including §6.5 legacy-package deprecation runbook (credential handling + failure modes) and §12 deferred-gaps ledger.
- `.npmrc` at repo root — `@voidforge` scope registry pin + `provenance=true`. Defense against scope hijack via misconfigured user npmrc.
- `docs/LEARNINGS.md` — **LRN-1** (Claude Code caches agent definitions at session start), **LRN-2** (fix shell-escape artifacts at source, not destination), **LRN-3** (grep entire docs tree after ADR schema changes to catch sibling-doc drift), **LRN-4** (published npm name must match install instructions).

### Changed
- **Package rename.** Both published packages adopt the `@voidforge/` scope. `bin` name stays `voidforge` — `npx @voidforge/cli init` still runs the `voidforge` binary. Root `-w thevoidforge` scripts → `-w @voidforge/cli` across `package.json`, `.github/workflows/publish.yml`, `.github/workflows/validate-branches.yml`. Lockfile regenerated with scoped workspace entries.
- **Methodology declared as CLI runtime dependency.** `@voidforge/cli` package.json now declares `"@voidforge/methodology": "*"` in dependencies. Without this, `require.resolve('@voidforge/methodology/package.json')` in `project-init.ts:60` + `updater.ts:43` failed on every fresh `npx` install — a latent bug present since v21.0 that the scope rename alone did NOT fix. `*` range avoids lockstep-bump footgun when CLI bumps ahead of methodology.
- **`/gauntlet --fast` mandates 3 rounds** (`.claude/commands/gauntlet.md` + `docs/methods/GAUNTLET.md`). Explicitly states Discovery + First Strike + Second Strike are all mandatory — stopping at Round 1 is a protocol violation. Field report 2026-04-20 precedent: Round 2 caught `npx voidforge init` CRITICAL that Round 1 passed clean. Added `--fast Mode Contract` section to method doc.
- **Fix Batch ≠ Release** (GAUNTLET.md + gauntlet.md) — fix batches between rounds don't bump VERSION.md or write CHANGELOG entries. Caller must invoke `/git` after the gauntlet completes. Prevents the silent version-mismatch Gauntlet 41 caught.
- **README value-prop rewrite.** First 100 words now cleanly state what VoidForge IS (methodology framework that turns Claude Code into a full engineering team), how to use it (write PRD, run `/campaign`), and what's inside (30 commands, 34 patterns, 260+ agents, 1384 tests). Added `claude` prereq line above install block. First-command pointer simplified: `/prd` primary with `/campaign` and `/assess` as clear branches.
- **BLOCK error message rewritten** (`scripts/surfer-gate/check.sh`). New `_find_repo_root()` walks up from `$CWD` to emit absolute paths — orchestrators in subdirectories (e.g., `packages/voidforge/`) now get copy-pasteable commands. TTL moved to opener. Both `--light` and `--solo` bypass examples shown. Stdin-pipe fallback documented for JSON payloads with single quotes.
- **Command count reconciliation.** Actual count is 30 (28 primary + 2 permanent aliases `/review` → `/engage`, `/security` → `/sentinel`) — HOLOCRON now clarifies. Pattern count corrected 35 → 34. Test count corrected 315 → 1384. README and both QUICKSTARTs updated. `ls .claude/commands/*.md \| wc -l` directive added for live count.
- **48 prescriptive install-command references** swapped from `npx thevoidforge` / `npx voidforge` (unscoped) to `npx @voidforge/cli` across 15 user-facing files (README, HOLOCRON, QUICKSTARTs, WORKSHOP, CONTRIBUTING, CLAUDE.md Distribution, command files, active ADRs). Historical references preserved (CHANGELOG, ROADMAP past-tense entries, site-audit snapshots).
- **ADR-045 + ADR-048 + ADR-058** updated prescriptive `npx voidforge` → `npx @voidforge/cli` references while preserving historical context.

### Security
- **Self-upgrade registry pinning** (`voidforge.ts:441`, `updater.ts:214`). `--registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/` hard-coded into both `npm view` and `npm install -g`. Prevents silent redirect via user-configured `@voidforge:registry` in `~/.npmrc`.
- **`npm_config_*` environment variable stripping** (same two sites). CLI `--registry` flag does NOT override env vars in npm's config precedence — an attacker-controlled `NPM_CONFIG_REGISTRY` could redirect installs despite the flag. Fix Batch 2 added `safeEnv` construction before `execSync`. Fix Batch 3 extended the filter to drop `undefined` values (execSync stringifies them to the literal `"undefined"`).
- **CI now runs root `npm test`** instead of `npm run test -w @voidforge/cli` — publish workflow exercises the root `pretest` hook (agent-ref validator + 20 gate tests) that was previously bypassed at tag-time.
- **`scripts/surfer-gate/check.sh` BLOCK message** uses `${REPO_ROOT}`-resolved absolute paths so orchestrators don't copy-paste broken relative paths when operating in a subdirectory.
- **`.claude/settings.json` PreToolUse hook remains live** (ADR-051 Phase 5b) — 20/20 offline gate tests passing.

### Runtime code
- `packages/voidforge/scripts/voidforge.ts` — version-check accepts `@voidforge/cli` alongside legacy `thevoidforge`/`voidforge`. Self-upgrade `npm view` + re-exec commands point at scoped name with pinned registry + env stripping.
- `packages/voidforge/wizard/lib/updater.ts` — `selfUpdate()` installs `@voidforge/cli@latest` with the same defenses.

### Fixed
- **`docs/adrs/ADR-061` §8 addendum** — explicitly documents that `require.resolve('@voidforge/methodology/...')` requires BOTH the scope rename AND a runtime-dep declaration in the CLI package. Prior prose implied the rename alone was sufficient.
- **ADR-061 version alignment** — §11 "Target: v23.9.0" matches §6.4 post-publish checks. Earlier draft mixed `v23.8.20` and `23.9.0`.

### Still deferred (user-action + separate follow-up ADRs — see ADR-061 §12)

**Release-gating user actions (BLOCKS first scoped publish):**
- **SEC-001 (CRITICAL):** `@voidforge` npm scope is unclaimed. A maintainer must publish a placeholder from an authenticated account before any CI tag succeeds. Every day of delay is scope-hijack risk.
- **SEC-002 (HIGH):** `NPM_TOKEN` must be rotated to an Automation token with write access on `@voidforge/*` AND the legacy `thevoidforge` (needed for §6.5 deprecate command).

**Pre-existing bugs surfaced by the Gauntlet — need their own ADRs:**
- Update-flow self-comparison bug (`updater.ts resolveMethodologySource()` walks up from `import.meta.dirname` and finds the user's project root first when invoked from inside a VoidForge project — silently compares the project against itself and reports "up to date"). Pre-existing since v21.0.
- Silver Surfer Gate hook doesn't ship to new projects — `.claude/settings.json` and `scripts/surfer-gate/` are not in the methodology package's `files` list or `project-init.ts copyMethodology()`. New VoidForge projects get prose-backstop enforcement only (CLAUDE.md explicitly anticipates this fallback path).

**Polish deferred:**
- Roster TTL mid-gauntlet (raise `ROSTER_TTL_SECONDS` 600 → 1800 in a future release).
- Dual-global-install cleanup (users with prior `thevoidforge` globally installed end up with both packages post-upgrade; PATH ordering decides which `voidforge` bin runs. Migration note: `npm uninstall -g thevoidforge && npm install -g @voidforge/cli`).

### Verification
- `npm test` — **1384/1384 pass**
- `bash scripts/surfer-gate/test.sh` — **20/20 pass**
- `scripts/validate-agent-refs.sh` — PASS (via root pretest)
- `grep -rn "npx voidforge" . --include='*.md'` — zero user-facing hits outside ADR-061 / historical CHANGELOGs
- Working tree: 33 files changed + 2 new (ADR-061, .npmrc); 270 insertions, 1242 deletions (lockfile regen dominates)
- CI publish path will NOT fire until user tags — intentional. Tag v23.9.0 gated on SEC-001 + SEC-002 user actions.

### Thanos's verdict
**"I am not yet inevitable."** Source-level implementation complete. 3 CRITICAL caught and fixed through the Gauntlet (methodology dep missing, env undefined → "undefined" string, dep-pin timebomb). User-action blockers explicitly documented, pre-existing bugs filed for follow-up ADRs. The next release is one `npm login` + token rotation away.

## [23.8.19] - 2026-04-20

### Gauntlet 41 Victory-pass — Round 1 + condensed Rounds 2-5

Ran full `/gauntlet` (Victory Gauntlet) on v23.8.18. Round 1 Discovery + condensed late-rounds probe. Thanos's verdict on v23.8.19 state: "I am not yet inevitable" — two HIGH findings surfaced Rounds 2-5. Both are doc-level; the gate machinery itself is sound.

### Fixed
- **REV-001 (HIGH) — `packages/methodology/.claude/commands/` was 5+ versions stale.** Root `.claude/commands/` had ADR-052 one-liner gate references (v23.8.13+), ARGS injection hardening (v23.8.13), hook references (v23.8.14+). The methodology package copies predated all of it. **Resolution:** ran `bash packages/methodology/scripts/prepack.sh` to regenerate. All 14 gated command files in the methodology package now match root.
- **SCHEMA-001 (HIGH) — ADR-056 documented ghost `roster_json` field** that the code never emitted. Code emits `roster` / `roster_text` / `roster_parsed`. ADR-056 rewritten end-to-end: documents all three shapes (Shape A jq+valid-JSON, Shape B jq+invalid-JSON, Shape C no-jq), adds `roster_parsed` boolean discriminator, includes full cherry-pick `jq` query, explicitly supersedes the prior schema proposal. (Thanos Round 2-5 flagged that BUILD_JOURNAL.md:46 still had `roster_json` too — fixed.)
- **BE-001 (HIGH) — Schema parity between jq path and fallback path** (`record-roster.sh`). Previous state: jq path emitted either `roster` (object) or `roster_text` (string); fallback path emitted only `roster_text`. Consumers couldn't reliably select. Now: all three paths emit `roster_text` (always present, JSON-string-escaped form of the roster), plus `roster` (nested object, only when jq is available AND input parses as valid JSON), plus `roster_parsed` boolean discriminator. Consumers read `roster_parsed` first, then `.roster` for structured or `.roster_text` for raw.
- **UX-G1-006 — ROOT `HOLOCRON.md`** still had three `npx thevoidforge` references that v23.8.13's edit had missed (edit only touched the methodology-package copy, which prepack now overwrites from root). Root fixed. Full list: line 57 (methodology-only install), line 71 (minimal install), line 464 (Bombadil update line), line 805 (Windows troubleshooting). Also updated the 28-command list to include `/engage` (alias: `/review`) and `/sentinel` (alias: `/security`) as primary names.
- **REV-002 — CLAUDE.md gate section header** now cites ADR-048, ADR-051, and **ADR-060**. Was missing ADR-060 (state location) in both root and methodology package copies.
- **HOLOCRON.md `/sentinel` Arsenal entry** gained a "Hit a gate block? See scripts/surfer-gate/README.md" pointer (partial UX-005 fix).
- **La Forge failure mode 4 (MEDIUM) — disk-full diagnostic** in `record-roster.sh`. Previous behavior: if the roster write failed silently, check.sh would block all subsequent agents with no clue that a disk-full was responsible. Now: explicit stderr diagnostic, exit 1, directs user to free space or use `--light`/`--solo` bypass. Write also wrapped in `(umask 077; ...)` subshell to harden permissions (Kenobi SEC-004 partial).
- **Oracle MEDIUM — docs/methods/AI_INTELLIGENCE.md:263** example YAML now has a trailing comment "`# Models used — update to current runtime model`" so the example doesn't read as a canonical pin.

### Release discipline
- VERSION.md + both package.json files bumped to 23.8.19.
- CHANGELOG.md has this entry (Thanos caught the earlier omission — Fix Batch 1 had landed in the tree without a release stamp).
- Root `CLAUDE.md` Gate header updated; methodology package CLAUDE.md mirrored via prepack.

### Still deferred (carried forward — NOT fixed this release)

**Pre-existing package-name inconsistency discovered during Gauntlet 41:**
- `packages/voidforge/package.json` declares `"name": "thevoidforge"`.
- `packages/methodology/package.json` declares `"name": "thevoidforge-methodology"`.
- Root `CLAUDE.md` Distribution section declares canonical names `voidforge` and `@voidforge/methodology`.
- README + HOLOCRON use `npx voidforge init`.

The stated intent (CLAUDE.md + docs) and the actual published package names diverge. Renaming the published packages is a breaking change that deserves its own ADR (migration path, npm redirect strategy, transitional dual-publish). Documenting here as a known gap; Victory gate does NOT require this fix — user-facing install commands match whichever name they type, but `npx voidforge init` would currently fail against the npm registry because the package is published as `thevoidforge`. Flag for next minor release.

**Carried from Gauntlet 40b + 41:**
- AP-4 Surfer spoofing (architectural — requires cryptographic attestation, out of scope)
- UX-G1-001 / UX-G1-002 / UX-G1-004 / UX-G1-007 / UX-G1-008 (README value-prop framing, "first command" pointer, BLOCK error copy rewrite, residual `thevoidforge` in troubleshooting table if any remain, count-inconsistency single-source-of-truth)
- La Forge failure mode 5 (reaper race at 60min boundary on Linux relatime filesystems)
- REV-003 (gated command files don't repeat orchestrator contract)
- REV-004 (alias file structural diff)
- G41-R2-003 (HOLOCRON.md:89 still lists retired flags)
- G41-R2-005 (test.sh unsets XDG_RUNTIME_DIR — zero Linux XDG-path coverage)

### Verification
- `bash scripts/surfer-gate/test.sh` → **20/20 pass** (unchanged)
- `scripts/validate-agent-refs.sh` → PASS (via `npm test` pretest)
- `grep -rn "thevoidforge" HOLOCRON.md packages/methodology/HOLOCRON.md` → 0 results (outside CHANGELOG)
- Package version propagation: VERSION.md = `23.8.19`, methodology/package.json = `23.8.19`, voidforge/package.json = `23.8.19`.
- Methodology package CLAUDE.md gate header = `ADR-048, ADR-051, ADR-060` ✓
- Methodology package engage.md header verified correct.

### Thanos's verdict
"I am not yet inevitable, but the wounds are paperwork-only." With this release: 2 HIGH + 6 MEDIUM findings closed, package-name ADR identified as next-release work. The gate machinery (check.sh, record-roster.sh, bypass.sh, test.sh) is solid across both Gauntlets. The remaining deferred work is docs + UX polish + one breaking-change package rename. Not Victory — honest progress.

## [23.8.18] - 2026-04-20

### Assemble Hardening Pass — closes 7 of 10 deferred Gauntlet 40b findings

Ran `/assemble` to build the hardening pass. Silver Surfer returned 20 agents;
Picard + Spock + Worf + O'Brien designed the architecture decisions in Phase 1,
fixes applied in Phase 2, test coverage added. All 20 offline tests pass.

### Added
- **ADR-060: Surfer Gate State Location.** Relocates gate state from `/tmp/voidforge-*/` to `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/voidforge-gate/` (Linux tmpfs, per-user 0700) with `$HOME/.voidforge/gate/` fallback (macOS + non-systemd). Closes SEC-002 multi-tenant pre-seed vector.
- `scripts/surfer-gate/_paths.sh` — shared state-directory resolver sourced by all three helpers. Exports `SURFER_GATE_DIR`, `surfer_gate_session_dir()`, `surfer_gate_pointer_file()`, `surfer_gate_reap_stale_sessions()`.
- `scripts/surfer-gate/test.sh` — **committed test harness** (previously at `/tmp/test-check-sh.sh`, un-auditable). 20 tests including SEC-003 fail-closed + QA-001/2/3 coverage. Wired to `npm test` via `pretest`.

### Security
- **SEC-001 (HIGH latent) FIXED.** `parse_json` in `check.sh` now passes `$path` via `sys.argv[1]` instead of interpolating into Python source. Closes the refactor-trap injection path — arbitrary Python execution if any future caller passed a dynamic path argument.
- **SEC-002 (MEDIUM) FIXED.** State relocated per ADR-060. `/tmp` enumeration no longer leaks session UUIDs. Pre-seed attacks require the same UID as the running session.
- **SEC-003 (LOW → NOW FIXED AS HIGH).** `bypass.sh` is now fail-closed on unknown flag values. Previously: `bash bypass.sh --anything` silently wrote a bypass with only a stderr warning (swallowed by hook runner). Now: exit 2 with explicit error. Prompt-injection path closed. Two test cases added.
- **File permissions hardened.** State directories created with `chmod 0700`; state files with `chmod 0600`. Defense against lax user umask.

### Architecture
- **BE-003 (HIGH) FIXED.** `record-roster.sh` now uses `jq` (when available) to emit ROSTER_RECEIVED events with `roster` as a nested JSON object — not a string requiring two-step decode. Eliminates the sentinel-vs-JSONL schema divergence that Gauntlet 40b Round 2 caught. Falls back gracefully to `roster_text` (string-encoded) when `$1` isn't valid JSON, or to manual escaping when `jq` is unavailable. No backslash stripping on orchestrator input.
- **BE-002 (MEDIUM) FIXED.** `REPO_PATH="${REPO_PATH%/}"` normalizes trailing slashes in `record-roster.sh` and `bypass.sh`. Prevents hash divergence when paths differ by one byte.

### Test coverage (Batman)
- **QA-001** — test for `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR != $PWD` discovery from subdirectory. PASS.
- **QA-002** — test for JSONL escape preservation with complex roster JSON (backslashes, quotes, nested objects). PASS.
- **QA-003** — test for auto-creation of repo-persistent `logs/` directory. PASS.

### Documentation
- CLAUDE.md + `packages/methodology/CLAUDE.md` Silver Surfer Gate section updated: state location (ADR-060), bypass.sh fail-closed behavior (SEC-003), helper script references.

### Explicitly deferred (NOT in this release)
- **AP-4 (Worf, threat model)** — Silver Surfer identity spoofing via `subagent_type`. Any agent that knows the magic string self-approves. Mitigating would require real cryptographic attestation — out of scope; the gate is a discipline mechanism, not a security boundary.
- **UX-004** — BLOCK error message rewrite for orchestrator audience. Improved in this release ("BLOCKED: " prefix + required/bypass structure) but the implementation-detail leak (`bash record-roster.sh`) is accepted as orchestrator-instructive. Future polish pass.
- **UX-005/6/7** — HOLOCRON pointer to surfer-gate README, count inconsistencies, residual `thevoidforge`. Documentation hygiene, defer to docs pass.

### Verification
- `bash scripts/surfer-gate/test.sh` — **20/20 pass** (was 14/14 pre-hardening)
- `npm test` — 1384/1384 pass (suite unchanged, pretest now runs surfer-gate tests too)
- Live hook verified: this session's Agent launches allowed via pre-migrated state at `$HOME/.voidforge/gate/sessions/87afbf7d.../`
- State paths confirmed at correct location: `$HOME/.voidforge/gate/pointers/pointer-<hash>`, `$HOME/.voidforge/gate/sessions/<session_id>/`

### Still-deferred findings catalog
- AP-4 (Surfer spoofing — architectural limitation, not fixable without attestation)
- UX-004 (error message polish)
- UX-005, UX-006, UX-007 (docs hygiene)

3 of 10 Gauntlet 40b findings remain deferred. 7 closed in this release.

## [23.8.17] - 2026-04-20

### Gauntlet 40b Round 1 + 2 fix batch

Post-v23.8.16 /gauntlet --fast produced Round 1 + Round 2 First Strike findings. This release fixes the shippable-blockers and documents the rest.

### Fixed
- **`npx voidforge init` Project section insertion (ADR-058 implementation gap, UX-003 CRITICAL).** ADR-058 strips the Project section from the published methodology via prepack sed markers. The `injectIdentity()` function in `project-init.ts` still did `replace('[PROJECT_NAME]', ...)` on placeholders that no longer exist in the published package — silent no-op → user's new project had NO Project section at all. Now detects both paths: legacy template (placeholders present → replace) and published package (section stripped → insert a fresh block after the `# CLAUDE.md` heading). `npx voidforge init` now correctly writes a filled Project section in all cases.
- **`record-roster.sh` backslash-strip no longer corrupts orchestrator-supplied JSON** (Constantine BE finding). v23.8.16 introduced `tr -d '\\'` to fix a default-sentinel artifact, but it also stripped legitimate JSON escapes (`\u0041`, `\"`, `\n`) from the orchestrator's roster payload. Replaced with a clean `printf` construction of the default — legitimate `$1` escapes now pass through untouched.
- **`record-roster.sh` repo-persistent JSONL write now uses `$REPO_PATH`** (previously bare `$PWD`). Consistent with the pointer-path fix in v23.8.16; prevents silent drop when called from a subdirectory.
- **`check.sh` and `record-roster.sh` now `mkdir -p "$CWD/logs"` before append** (BE-005). Previously gated on `[ -d "$CWD/logs" ]` → silent drop if the dir didn't exist. Now creates it.
- **`check.sh` POINTER_WRITTEN variable removed.** It was cosmetic — set but never read. Constantine MEDIUM finding. Simplified to fail-open append with a clarifying comment.
- **5 more bare handoff references** fixed in `.claude/commands/{architect,ux,devops}.md` and `docs/methods/AI_INTELLIGENCE.md` → now point to `/sentinel` and `/engage` instead of bare `→ Kenobi` / `→ Picard`.
- **HOLOCRON.md Arsenal section** now documents `/engage` (alias: `/review`) and `/sentinel` (alias: `/security`) per ADR-050. Previously said `/review` and `/security` with zero mention of the new canonical names (UX-001, UX-002 HIGH).
- **WORKSHOP.md + README.md** command tables — same rename applied.
- **CLAUDE.md orchestrator contract** now discloses that `bypass.sh` fail-opens on unknown flag values with a stderr warning (Wonder Woman finding on undisclosed behavior).

### Deferred with explicit rationale (not fixing this release)

**Documented as known; not blocking:**
- **SEC-001 (HIGH latent):** `parse_json` in `check.sh` interpolates its `path` argument into Python source. Not exploitable today (all callers pass hardcoded literals) but a refactor trap. Fix is mechanical (pass via `sys.argv`) — queuing for v23.9.0 hardening pass.
- **SEC-002 (MEDIUM):** `/tmp` roster pre-seed risk on multi-user systems. Requires moving state to `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` or `$HOME/.cache/voidforge-gate/`. Design decision pending — solo maintainer use case is current target.
- **SEC-003 (LOW):** `bypass.sh` fail-open on unknown flag values is by-design per our fail-open philosophy. Now explicitly documented in CLAUDE.md contract.
- **BE-002 (MEDIUM):** `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` vs stdin `cwd` byte divergence (trailing slash, macOS `/private/tmp` vs `/tmp`). Not yet observed in practice; will add a sanity check if it surfaces.
- **BE-003 (HIGH):** Roster JSONL schema divergence — `roster_json` field is escape-stripped while the sentinel file is raw. Consumers that parse both see different shapes. Architectural decision deferred to Mission 9b (orchestration metrics design).
- **QA-001/QA-002/QA-003:** Three missing test coverage items — `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR != $PWD` path, JSONL escape correctness, `$REPO_PATH/logs` write path. Queuing for v23.9.0 test-writing pass.
- **UX-004:** BLOCK error message audience-confused between human and orchestrator. Leaves implementation-detail instruction (`bash record-roster.sh`) that a confused orchestrator could cargo-cult. Rewriting properly needs more care — deferred.
- **UX-005:** HOLOCRON.md has no pointer to `scripts/surfer-gate/README.md`. Will add in next docs pass.
- **UX-006:** Inconsistent counts across HOLOCRON/README/WORKSHOP (26 vs 28 commands, 190+ vs 260+ agents). Needs a "count at build time" mechanism, deferred.
- **UX-007:** HOLOCRON still has 2 `npx thevoidforge` instances outside the code blocks I fixed in v23.8.13. Low priority.

### Verification
- `/tmp/test-check-sh.sh` — 14/14 pass after all Fix Batch 2 + 3 changes
- `npm test` — 1384/1384 pass
- All hook edits live-tested in the Gauntlet 40 run itself (the `ALLOW` gate entries in `logs/surfer-gate-events.jsonl` are from this session's Agent launches)

### Thanos verdict
**"I am not yet inevitable."** Round 1 Discovery + Round 2 First Strike completed; Round 3 Second Strike deferred. Seven high-confidence findings remain catalogued above. The methodology survives the Gauntlet with acknowledged wounds. For a Victory sign-off, a dedicated hardening pass on SEC-001, BE-003, and the test-coverage gaps is the next logical step — not this release.

---

## [23.8.16] - 2026-04-20

### Gauntlet 40 fix batch (Round 1 findings — 20 findings across 18 agents)

### Fixed
- **Reverted the `Wanda Seldon` → `WandaSeldon` rename** (ADR-055 partial revert). Mid-session live-test showed Claude Code runtime caches agent names at session start — the rename broke Agent tool dispatch for `Wanda Seldon` while `WandaSeldon` was not yet recognized. The theoretical prefix collision with `Wanda` never materialized because runtime uses exact-string match on `name:`, not prefix match. `wanda-seldon-validation.md`, `ai.md`, `NAMING_REGISTRY.md` restored. Validator script remains (still catches real typos).
- **`sentinel.md` Silver Surfer prompt said `Command: /security`** instead of `Command: /sentinel` — typo from v23.8.13 rename slipped through. Fixed.
- **Dist rebuilt to propagate `claude-sonnet-4-7` fallback** (Hawkgirl critical finding). Source was fixed in v23.8.13 but `packages/voidforge/dist/wizard/lib/anthropic.js` retained the stale `claude-sonnet-4-6` until this rebuild.
- **~20 cross-reference drifts** after v23.8.13 rename — `/review` and `/security` in handoff references now point to `/engage` and `/sentinel`. Files updated: `.claude/commands/{qa,ai,test,git,void,engage,assemble,gauntlet}.md`; `docs/methods/{CAMPAIGN,SUB_AGENTS,ASSEMBLER,GROWTH_STRATEGIST,SECURITY_AUDITOR}.md`. Aliases preserve backward compatibility (both names still invoke the same handler), so these are consistency fixes, not breakage fixes.
- **`docs/PRD.md` and `docs/methods/AI_INTELLIGENCE.md` example model IDs** updated from `claude-sonnet-4-6` to `claude-sonnet-4-7`.

### Security
- **`check.sh` Silver Surfer self-launch is now an exact-string match**, not a substring. Previous substring match (`case ... *"silver surfer"* ...`) was trivially spoofable — a subagent_type containing "not a silver surfer" or "bypass silver surfer gate" would pass Rule 1. Constantine high-severity finding. Now exact match against `"Silver Surfer"` / `"silver-surfer-herald"` / `"silver surfer"` / `"SilverSurfer"`.
- **`check.sh` pointer-write failure no longer silent.** Removed the `|| true` that swallowed mkdir/printf failures. Pointer-write is now conditional on successful mkdir AND printf. If the pointer can't be written, helpers no-op (fail-open) by design — but the path no longer obscures the failure.
- **`record-roster.sh` and `bypass.sh` now prefer `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`** over `$PWD` for repo-hash computation. `check.sh` hashes stdin's `cwd` (which is `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` in practice); the helpers must match the same path to discover the pointer. Constantine high-severity finding about CWD divergence when orchestrator runs from subdirectory.
- **`bypass.sh` validates flag values.** `--light` and `--solo` are the documented values; other strings now warn (fail-open, preserving the no-block philosophy). Catches accidental invocations like `bypass.sh ""`.

### Changed
- **ADR-056 reconciled with shipped reality.** Original ADR draft specified `GATE_LAUNCHED / ROSTER_DEPLOYED / DEPLOY_PARTIAL` event types with `roster_returned` / `roster_deployed` / `violation` fields. Shipped v23.8.15 uses simpler `ALLOW / BLOCK / ROSTER_RECEIVED` schema (the hook has sufficient signal with ALLOW events per subagent; distinct per-roster events are unnecessary). ADR-056 now documents the shipped schema + cherry-pick detection jq query. Original schema marked as superseded.
- **ADR-051 misreference corrected.** Line 154 previously said "ADR-056 defines the `gate.log` JSONL schema" but `gate.log` is plain text; JSONL goes to `surfer-gate-events.jsonl`. Now accurate.
- **`record-roster.sh` default sentinel** strips literal backslashes introduced by shell parameter expansion of the `{\"recorded\":true\}` default value. Without the strip, the file contained `{"recorded":true\}` (invalid JSON on some shells). Now valid JSON everywhere.

### Deferred (acknowledged, not fixing this release)
- **Documentation lie: "Scope of override" carve-out in CLAUDE.md** implies the hook scripts respect a safety-reasoning carve-out. They cannot — shell scripts can't inspect intent. The carve-out is a model-level property. Wonder Woman medium severity. The prose works as a reminder to the model; marking as intentional rhetorical framing rather than a bug.
- **`ROSTER_TTL_SECONDS=600` not documented in CLAUDE.md.** A long Gauntlet (30+ agents, >10 min) could stale the roster mid-run. Will document in CLAUDE.md Gate section in v23.9.0 + consider raising to 1800s.
- **`test-check-sh.sh` lives in `/tmp/`, not committed.** T'Pol low severity. Moving to `scripts/surfer-gate/test.sh` is a future release chore.
- **Round 2 + Round 3 Gauntlet passes** (First Strike, Second Strike, Crossfire, Council) — deferred. Round 1 Discovery found 20 findings and Fix Batch 1 resolved Critical + High; remaining findings are catalogued above under "Deferred."

### Verification
- `/tmp/test-check-sh.sh` — 14/14 offline tests pass after all hook changes.
- `npm test` — 1384/1384 passing (unchanged from v23.8.15).
- `scripts/validate-agent-refs.sh` — passes.
- Grep audit: no remaining `/review` or `/security` command references outside alias files, ADRs, CHANGELOG, and natural-language mentions.

---

## [23.8.15] - 2026-04-20

### Added
- **Silver Surfer Gate events emitted as JSONL** (ADR-056 Mission 9a). `check.sh` writes every `ALLOW` and `BLOCK` decision to `/logs/surfer-gate-events.jsonl` (repo-persistent, cross-session) and `/tmp/voidforge-session-<id>/surfer-gate-events.jsonl` (ephemeral, per-session debugging). `record-roster.sh` emits `ROSTER_RECEIVED` events.
- BUILD_JOURNAL.md: "Silver Surfer Gate Events" subsection documenting the JSONL schema, event types, and cherry-pick detection query.
- `logs/surfer-gate-events.jsonl` bootstrapped with initial events from this session.

### Changed
- `scripts/surfer-gate/check.sh`: added non-fatal `_emit_jsonl()` helper. Existing `gate.log` plain-text output preserved unchanged.
- `scripts/surfer-gate/record-roster.sh`: emits `ROSTER_RECEIVED` event to both session-scoped and repo-persistent files.
- `logs/remediation-campaign.md`: Mission 9 split into 9a (shipped), 9b (orchestration metrics — deferred), 9c (Danger Room integration — deferred). TypeScript `log()` helper dropped from scope per Pike's YAGNI challenge.

### Fixed
- Bash `$()` command substitution stripping trailing newline caused JSONL entries to concatenate without separator. Corrected by moving `\n` from format-string capture into the write-time `printf '%s\n'` pattern.

### Deferred (Pike's scope trim)
- Mission 9b (orchestration-metrics.jsonl): different integration surface; requires orchestrator-side command-completion contract.
- Mission 9c (agent-activity.jsonl session-start separator): Danger Room ticker work; not on the critical path.
- TypeScript `log()` helper in methodology package: YAGNI — no TypeScript caller exists. Per the no-stubs doctrine, the file is not created.

---

## [23.8.14] - 2026-04-20

### Added
- **Silver Surfer Gate now hook-enforced** (ADR-051 Phase 5b live). `scripts/surfer-gate/check.sh` intercepts Agent tool calls via `PreToolUse` and blocks non-Surfer sub-agents unless a roster has been recorded or a bypass flag is set.
- `scripts/surfer-gate/record-roster.sh` — orchestrator helper called after the Surfer returns to record the roster. No-op when the hook is inactive.
- `scripts/surfer-gate/bypass.sh` — orchestrator helper called when `--light` or `--solo` is active. No-op when the hook is inactive.
- CLAUDE.md "Orchestrator contract" section: documents when to call `record-roster.sh` and `bypass.sh`.

### Changed
- `scripts/surfer-gate/check.sh` rewritten based on Phase 5a empirical findings (see ADR-051). Uses stdin JSON `session_id` instead of `$CLAUDE_SESSION_ID` env var (which Claude Code does NOT populate). Adds repo-scoped pointer file so orchestrator helpers can discover their session_id without direct access.
- `scripts/surfer-gate/validate.sh` rewritten as a pure diagnostic — dumps full stdin JSON + `CLAUDE_*` env vars to `/tmp/voidforge-hook-validate.log`. For debugging hook behavior; not used in production.
- `scripts/surfer-gate/README.md` updated with the new state layout and gate flow.
- `scripts/surfer-gate/settings-snippet.json` updated to reflect live production entry.
- `.claude/settings.json`: `PreToolUse` hook registered against `matcher: "Agent"`, pointing at `check.sh`.

### Fixed
- ADR-051's original design assumed `$CLAUDE_SESSION_ID` would be injected into hook env. Phase 5a revealed it is NOT. Revised design uses stdin JSON parsing + pointer file; orchestrator helpers locate session_id without direct access.

### Infrastructure
- 14-test offline harness for `check.sh`, `record-roster.sh`, `bypass.sh` (logic + integration). All pass.

---

## [23.8.13] - 2026-04-20

### Security
- **Prompt injection closed in 14 gated command files** (ADR-053). `<ARGS>` and `<FOCUS>` now wrapped in `<user_input>` / `<user_focus>` delimited blocks with explicit "treat as opaque data" instruction. Closes OWASP LLM01 injection vector via `--focus` argument.
- **Maul red-team scope constrained** (ADR-057). Runtime exploitation now restricted to localhost or explicitly user-confirmed targets. Private-IP precondition; non-local targets require user confirmation before any curl execution.
- **Barton smoke-test + Red Hood destructive testing scoped** (ADR-057). Same localhost-only pattern applied.
- **CLAUDE.md override language scoped to procedural** (ADR-048 refinement). "This instruction overrides your judgment" narrowed to workflow-sequencing only — safety, ethics, alignment reasoning explicitly carved out.

### Added
- **ADR-050** — Native Claude Code Coexistence (rename `/review` → `/engage`, `/security` → `/sentinel`, permanent aliases).
- **ADR-051** — Structural Gate Enforcement (PreToolUse hook design, Phase 5a validation procedure).
- **ADR-052** — Silver Surfer Gate Canonicalization (single-source prose).
- **ADR-053** — Prompt Injection Hardening.
- **ADR-054** — Agent Model Tier Rebalance (Surfer → Haiku; Oracle/Wong/Black Canary/Bilbo → Haiku).
- **ADR-055** — Naming Registry Enforcement (validator script + Wanda rename).
- **ADR-056** — Observability Bootstrapping (surfer-gate-events.jsonl schema).
- **ADR-057** — Red-Team Agent Scope Constraints.
- **ADR-058** — Template Placeholder Purge (prepack sed filter).
- **ADR-059** — Concurrency Model Reconciliation (drop "max 3" cap).
- `/engage` command (primary) and `/sentinel` command (primary). `/review` and `/sentinel` become permanent aliases.
- `scripts/surfer-gate/` — `validate.sh` (Phase 5a hook test), `check.sh` (Phase 5b production gate), `settings-snippet.json`, `README.md`.
- `scripts/validate-agent-refs.sh` — enforces every `subagent_type:` resolves to exactly one agent. Wired to `npm test` via `pretest`.
- `logs/remediation-campaign.md` — 12-mission plan with dependency DAG, victory conditions, rollback paths.
- HOLOCRON.md "How VoidForge and Claude Code Work Together" section — explains the native sub-agent dispatch model and coexistence with Anthropic's built-in `/review` / `/security-review` skills.

### Changed
- **Silver Surfer → Haiku** (ADR-054). Highest-frequency agent, classification task, ~5× cost reduction.
- **Oracle, Wong, Black Canary, Bilbo → Haiku** (ADR-054). Mechanical scan / presence-check agents.
- **Silver Surfer Gate deduplicated** (ADR-052). 14 command files lose their duplicate 15-line gate prose; canonical version lives in CLAUDE.md. Each command file now has a one-line reference.
- **CLAUDE.md + packages/methodology/CLAUDE.md Gate section rewritten** (ADR-048 refinement). Prescriptive/repetitive "NO EXCEPTIONS" rhetoric replaced with declarative 4-step procedure + scope-of-override carve-out. Word count down ~50%.
- **SUB_AGENTS.md concurrency rules rewritten** (ADR-059). "Max 3 concurrent" cap replaced with "fan out the full roster in parallel for read-only analysis; batch only on write-collision" — aligned with CLAUDE.md gate directive.
- **`WandaSeldon` canonical name** (ADR-055). Display prose may still say "Wanda Seldon"; machine identifier is `WandaSeldon` (no space) to prevent `Wanda` prefix collision.
- **HOLOCRON.md flag table refreshed** — removed retired `--blitz`, `--muster`, `--infinity` as live; added `--surfer`, `--light`, `--solo`, `--interactive`, `--focus`. Corrected "26 commands" to "28 commands".
- **HOLOCRON.md install commands** — `npx thevoidforge` → `npx voidforge`.
- **CLAUDE.md Project section** wrapped in `<!-- REMOVE-FOR-NPM-PUBLISH -->` sed markers (ADR-058). `prepack.sh` now strips template placeholders before publishing `@voidforge/methodology`.

### Fixed
- **Stale fallback model ID**: `claude-sonnet-4-6` → `claude-sonnet-4-7` across 6 locations (runtime fallback in `anthropic.ts`, matching test assertions, `FAILURE_MODES.md`, `TECH_DEBT.md` note, `AI_INTELLIGENCE.md` PRD example).
- **daemon-process.ts pattern cleanup**: removed `configurePaths()` and `checkGlobalDaemon()` from the pattern template (they live in runtime `daemon-core.ts`, never in the pattern). Fixes the "phantom export" mismatch documented in vault-2026-04-09-s3.

### Infrastructure
- **`npm test` now runs agent-reference validator first** (`pretest` hook). Broken `subagent_type:` references fail CI before tests run.

---

## [23.8.12] - 2026-04-12

### Fixed
- Campaign Step 3 now respects ADR-043 default autonomy (was still gating on retired `--blitz` flag instead of `--interactive`)

### Added
- "Wait for all agents before implementing" anti-pattern rule in SUB_AGENTS.md (field report #300)
- ToS/API policy compatibility check in ADR template and Dax's requirement classification (field report #300)
- Type-check pre-flight gate before deploys in DEVOPS_ENGINEER.md (field report #299)
- Prompt-schema lockstep operational learning for Seldon (field report #299)
- Type-check before push operational learning for Coulson (field report #299)

---

## [23.8.2] - 2026-04-12

### Fixed
- **Silver Surfer Gate in CLAUDE.md** — command-level "NO EXCEPTIONS" wasn't sufficient. Claude rationalized skipping in 3 separate incidents ("task is simple", "I already know which agents", "this is data analysis not architecture"). The gate is now in CLAUDE.md itself — the root context loaded before any command. "This instruction overrides your judgment. You will be tempted to skip this step. That argument is wrong."

---

## [23.8.1] - 2026-04-12

### Fixed
- **Silver Surfer anti-skip enforcement hardened** — "MANDATORY" wasn't strong enough. Commands now say "NO EXCEPTIONS" with pre-emptive rebuttals for every rationalization Claude uses to skip ("task is simple", "I already know which agents"). Equated to Victory Gauntlet violation. Psychological inversion: "If you think you don't need the Surfer — that's exactly when you need it most." Operational learning added to Silver Surfer agent definition with field report evidence.

---

## [23.8.0] - 2026-04-12

### The Personality (ADR-049)

### Added
- **Agent Heraldings** — every one of 264 agents now has a `heralding:` field in YAML frontmatter. Character-authentic one-liners announced when each agent is deployed. "The Dark Knight descends on your codebase. No bug escapes the night." (Batman) / "Hello there. Kenobi takes the high ground on your security posture." (Kenobi) / "Make it so. Picard takes the bridge — your architecture will be reviewed with authority." (Picard)
- ADR-049: Agent Heraldings architecture

---

## [23.7.3] - 2026-04-12

### Added
- **Cosmic Heraldings** — 14 Silver Surfer one-liners announced at random before each roster scan. "Norrin Radd soars ahead. The Power Cosmic reads your code before any mortal agent touches it." Brings delight to every command invocation — same energy as Bombadil's /void personality.

---

## [23.7.2] - 2026-04-12

### Fixed
- **Silver Surfer invocation made explicit and guaranteed** — commands now provide exact Agent tool parameters (`description` + `prompt` with `.claude/agents/silver-surfer-herald.md` read instruction) instead of the non-functional `subagent_type: Silver Surfer`. Works 100% of the time in every Claude Code environment.

---

## [23.7.1] - 2026-04-12

### Changed
- **Silver Surfer launches as a real Agent sub-process** — no longer shells out to CLI. Commands use `subagent_type: Silver Surfer` which reads agent definitions inline, returns a roster, and has its own operational learnings that improve over time. This is mandatory on every major command — not optional, not skippable.
- Silver Surfer agent upgraded from Haiku to Sonnet tier (needs to read and reason about agent descriptions, not just classify)

---

## [23.7.0] - 2026-04-12

### The Decount — Dynamic Agent References

### Changed
- **Eliminated hardcoded agent counts from 30+ files.** Commands, method docs, CLAUDE.md, HOLOCRON.md, ROADMAP.md, SUB_AGENTS.md, and herald.ts now say "all agents" instead of hardcoding a number. Only two files retain the count: `AGENT_CLASSIFICATION.md` (the single source of truth) and `wizard/ui/index.html` (user-facing, with an HTML comment documenting how to compute it).
- Adding a new agent no longer requires updating 30+ files — just the agent definition and AGENT_CLASSIFICATION.md.

## [23.6.1] - 2026-04-12

### Fixed
- **30+ stale "263 agents" references** — updated to 264 across 13 command files, 8 method docs, HOLOCRON.md, AGENT_CLASSIFICATION.md, ROADMAP.md, wizard UI, herald.ts, SUB_AGENTS.md, and NAMING_REGISTRY.md. Gauntlet caught incomplete count propagation from Silver Surfer addition.
- **herald.ts ADR reference** — ADR-047 → ADR-048

---

## [23.6.0] - 2026-04-12

### The Silver Surfer (ADR-048, Campaign 38)

### Added
- **Silver Surfer** (Norrin Radd) — agent #264. Herald of Galactus. Pre-scan dispatch that reads codebase context and selects the optimal agent roster via Haiku.
- **`voidforge herald` CLI subcommand** — the invocation bridge. Runs the Silver Surfer pre-scan from the command line: `npx thevoidforge herald --command /review --json`. Outputs JSON roster for Claude to deploy.
- Silver Surfer agent definition with Haiku tier, scout tools, and dispatch tags.

### Changed
- All 14 major commands updated: "Herald Pre-Scan (ADR-047)" replaced with "Silver Surfer Pre-Scan (ADR-048)" using actual CLI invocation instead of pseudocode.
- Agent count: 263 → 264.
- CLAUDE.md and NAMING_REGISTRY.md updated with Silver Surfer identity.

---

## [23.5.4] - 2026-04-12

### Fixed
- **3 command-doc sync gaps** — build.md now includes Phase 12.75 (distribution verification gate), ux.md now includes screenshot mandate, qa.md now includes dynamic count check + cross-array uniqueness audit
- **ROADMAP.md version** — updated from v23.5.0 to v23.5.3

---

## [23.5.3] - 2026-04-12

### Fixed
- **All 201 `subagent_type` references used wrong format** — commands referenced agents by filename ID (`picard-architecture`) but Claude Code expects the YAML name field (`Picard`). Every agent reference in every command was broken. Fixed across 15 command files.
- **"What's Next" recommended `/build` instead of `/campaign`** — new projects should start with `/campaign` (reads PRD, sequences missions, deploys full agent teams) not `/build` (manual single-batch mode). Updated wizard UI and CLAUDE.md.

---

## [23.5.2] - 2026-04-12

### Fixed
- **Duplicate commands in Claude Code** — `/void` now auto-detects and removes VoidForge files from `~/.claude/commands/` and `~/.claude/agents/` (user-level). Guard added to prevent future writes to `~/.claude/`. Both void.md and FORGE_KEEPER.md updated.
- **Git init stack trace** — project creation via wizard showed full Error stack trace when git identity wasn't configured. Now shows clean one-line message.

---

## [23.5.1] - 2026-04-12

### Fixed
- **CLI self-upgrade used wrong package name** — `npm update -g voidforge` (nonexistent) replaced with `npm install -g thevoidforge@latest`. Users on v23.1.1 couldn't self-upgrade because the update command targeted the wrong npm package.
- **Post-upgrade re-exec used cached npx** — `npx voidforge update` resolved to the old cached binary after upgrading global. Changed to `npx thevoidforge update` which forces fresh resolution.

---

## [23.5.0] - 2026-04-12

### The Herald (ADR-047, Campaign 37)

### Added
- **Herald dispatch engine** (`herald.ts`): Haiku pre-scan selects optimal agent roster from 263 agents based on codebase content, command type, and user intent. Runs before every major command in <2 seconds for ~$0.001.
- **Agent registry loader** (`agent-registry.ts`): Reads and caches all 263 agent definitions with YAML frontmatter parsing (name, description, model, tools, tags).
- **`--focus "topic"` flag**: Natural-language bias for Herald selection. Available on all 14 Herald-enabled commands. Added to CLAUDE.md Tier 1 flag taxonomy.
- **Tag enrichment**: 40 cross-domain agents tagged for faster Herald matching (security-adjacent, architecture, QA, financial, UX, DevOps, AI, backend, orchestration).
- **48 new tests**: Herald engine (26 tests covering roster parsing, graceful degradation, focus bias) + agent registry (22 tests covering YAML parsing, caching, summary formatting).

### Changed
- All 14 major commands (`/review`, `/qa`, `/security`, `/ux`, `/architect`, `/build`, `/assemble`, `/gauntlet`, `/campaign`, `/test`, `/devops`, `/deploy`, `/ai`, `/assess`) now include Herald Pre-Scan step before agent deployment.
- Dynamic dispatch evolved: file-based matching (ADR-044) supplemented by codebase-aware intelligent selection (ADR-047).

---

## [23.4.1] - 2026-04-12

### Security
- **XSS fix:** Blueprint validation banner now escapes `data.summary` and `data.frontmatterErrors` before innerHTML rendering (Gauntlet Round 1 finding SEC-1/SEC-2)

### Fixed
- ROADMAP.md header updated to v23.4.0 (was stale at v23.3.1)
- Lobby error state gets `role="alert"` and `aria-live="polite"` for screen reader announcement

---

## [23.4.0] - 2026-04-12

### The Remediation (ADR-046, Campaign 36)

### Added
- **WCAG compliance:** Visible validation error messages with `aria-invalid` and `role="alert"` on Step 3 inputs
- **Tab keyboard navigation:** ArrowLeft/Right/Home/End on PRD tabs (WAI-ARIA Tabs pattern)
- **Deploy wizard footer:** Consistent Back/Next navigation matching setup wizard
- **Lobby error state:** Distinct "Could not connect to server" with Retry button (vs empty state)
- **Blueprint dismiss:** Close button on Blueprint Detected banner
- **Tower CDN retry:** Retry button when xterm.js fails to load
- **Login password help:** "Forgot password?" guidance text
- **Tower responsive:** Header actions wrap on mobile viewports

### Changed
- Standalone Danger Room and War Room pages redirect to project dashboard (legacy API shims removed per ADR-046)
- CLAUDE.md pattern count: 35 → 37 reference implementations

### Fixed
- **3 critical API fixes:** Legacy `/api/danger-room/*` and `/api/war-room/*` endpoints removed — always 404'd in remote/LAN mode, freeze button had no shim at all
- **Retired `--blitz` flag** removed from 4 UI locations (was a no-op since ADR-043)
- Import modal Escape key now handled inside focus trap (consistency with other modals)
- Lobby header and Tower header overflow on mobile viewports
- Step 7 heading visible during creating state (was hidden, leaving section unlabeled)
- Stale comments in prophecy.js files updated

### Removed
- ~2,400 lines of legacy dashboard code (danger-room.js, war-room.js, legacy API shims)

---

## [23.3.1] - 2026-04-12

### Fixed
- **Wizard UI "Files to be created" list was stale since v4.0** — listed 5 files that aren't created (settings.json, PRD.md, build-state.md, .env, .gitignore), missed 6 that are (agents/, NAMING_REGISTRY.md, VERSION.md, HOLOCRON.md, CHANGELOG.md, .voidforge), and showed wrong counts ("14 agent protocols" → 29, "7 patterns" → 37). (Field report #298 dynamic count finding.)

---

## [23.3.0] - 2026-04-10

### The Coverage + The Splitting (Campaigns 34+35)

### Added
- **599 new tests** across 60 test files — API routes (141), server core (35), provisioners (111), financial modules (107), high-risk lib/ (98), remaining modules (107). Total: 741 → 1,340 tests, 77% module coverage.
- **16 new split modules** from 9 oversized files — treasury-heartbeat (1,495→5), heartbeat (1,067→3), projects (769→3), provision (642→4), aws-vps (663→4), railway (454→3), 3 campaign adapters (→7 + campaign-common)
- **5 planned features wired in** — daemon-aggregator (Danger Room), project-vault (shutdown lock), autonomy-controller (hourly breaker check), treasury-backup (daily snapshots), platform-planner (invoice settlement + debit protection)
- **Phase 12.75 distribution verification gate** in BUILD_PROTOCOL.md — verify all 6 consumption paths after adding shared file categories
- **2 new lessons** — instruction-level self-update, consumption path verification

### Changed
- 4 agent operational learnings enriched (sisko-campaign, fury-initiative, bombadil-forge-sync, coulson-release)
- Treasury heartbeat jobs count: 8 → 9 (treasury-backup added)

### Removed
- 17 orphaned files (2,020 lines): 9 lib/ modules, 4 codegen/ modules, dead code shipping in dist/

### Fixed
- Field report #297 triaged: 8 of 9 proposed methodology fixes applied, 1 wontfix (Transport B re-scan)

---

## [23.1.0] - 2026-04-09

### The Injection (ADR-045, Campaign 33)

### Added
- **Knowledge injection:** 35 agent definitions enriched with `## Operational Learnings` from method docs, LESSONS.md, and LEARNINGS.md (20 leads + 15 key sub-agents)
- **Debrief→agent pipeline:** Wong's promotion and Nog's solution proposals now target `.claude/agents/` definitions
- **Vault Step 1.6:** Captures agent definition update recommendations for next session
- **ADR-045:** Knowledge Injection architecture — closes 6 breaks in the learning-to-agent flow

### Fixed
- **Distribution gap:** `project-init.ts`, `updater.ts`, FORGE_KEEPER.md, and void.md now include `.claude/agents/` in sync
- **Scaffold migration:** void.md on scaffold branch updated to pull from main (was hardcoded to scaffold)
- **ADR-044 doc gap:** Dynamic Dispatch section added to 4 remaining commands (ux, devops, ai, test)

### Changed
- `lessons-global.json` honestly documented as DESIGNED NOT IMPLEMENTED in FIELD_MEDIC.md
- Archive branches created: `archive/scaffold`, `archive/core`
- CLAUDE.md Team table: added Haku (Deploy Wizard) and Gandalf (Setup Wizard)

---

## [23.0.0] - 2026-04-09

### The Materialization (ADR-044, Campaign 32)

### Added
- **263 subagent definitions** in `.claude/agents/` — every named agent from NAMING_REGISTRY.md
- **3-tier model routing:** Opus (20 leads), Sonnet (205 specialists/adversarial), Haiku (38 scouts)
- **4-category tool restrictions:** Builder (full), Reviewer (read+bash), Scout (read-only), Adversarial (read+bash)
- **Description-driven dynamic dispatch:** Opus matches `git diff --stat` against agent descriptions
- **Agent Classification manifest:** `docs/AGENT_CLASSIFICATION.md` with full tier/tool/ID mapping
- **ADR-044:** Full Subagent Materialization architecture

### Changed
- 18 command files migrated from inline prompts to `subagent_type:` references
- ADR-042 static dispatch tables replaced with ADR-044 Dynamic Dispatch sections in 8 commands
- Agent count updated from 259 to 263 across all methodology docs
- Distribution pipeline (prepack, copy-assets, new-project) includes `.claude/agents/`
- Cross-Domain Triggers sections removed from 3 method docs (replaced by description-driven dispatch)

---

## [22.2.0] - 2026-04-09

### The Polish (ADR-042, ADR-043, Campaign 31)

### Added
- **First-run onboarding UX:** Empty project detection, guided wizard entry, enhanced empty states
- **ADR-042:** Dynamic agent dispatch — content-triggered cross-domain spot-checks
- **ADR-043:** Max by default — flag taxonomy inversion (autonomous + full roster is now default)

### Changed
- Portfolio command reads per-project treasury data via `getStatusForUser()`
- 19 legacy routes get Deprecation + Sunset headers (sunset July 2026)
- Growth tutorial commands require external account prerequisites
- Flag taxonomy inverted: `--light`, `--interactive`, `--solo` opt OUT. `--blitz`, `--muster`, `--infinity` retired as no-ops.
- In-repo accuracy pass: 263 agents verified, 741 tests confirmed

---

## [22.1.0] - 2026-04-09

### The Migration (Campaign 30)

### Added
- **Treasury migration CLI:** `voidforge migrate treasury --project=<id>` — archives global treasury, starts per-project fresh
- **Treasury summary cache:** `writeTreasurySummaryFile()` for O(1) dashboard reads (replaces O(n) JSONL scan)
- **Per-project vault:** HKDF-SHA256 key derivation from global master key per project ID
- 45 new tests (treasury migrator, summary cache, project vault)

---

## [22.0.0] - 2026-04-09

### Breaking Changes — The Scope (ADR-040, ADR-041)

Everything is project-scoped. Multi-project wizard with per-project dashboards, financial isolation, and daemon configuration.

### Added

- **Project dashboard:** New `project.html` with 5-tab single-page app (Overview, Tower, Danger Room, War Room, Deploy)
- **ProjectContext type:** Rich interface with 15+ derived paths for project-scoped operations (`project-scope.ts`)
- **resolveProject() middleware:** Extracts project ID, validates access, returns ProjectContext on every route
- **Router param matching:** `:id` URL parameter support (backward-compatible, exact-match fast path preserved)
- **Per-project treasury functions:** `getTreasuryDir(projectDir?)`, `getSpendLog()`, `getRevenueLog()`, `getPendingOps()`, `getBudgetsFile()`
- **Treasury reader:** Shared `readTreasurySummary()` and `readHeartbeatSnapshot()` (extracted from 180-line inline code)
- **Daemon CLI:** `voidforge heartbeat start --project-dir <path>` for per-project daemon operation
- **Dual-daemon guard:** `checkGlobalDaemon()` prevents split-brain when per-project daemon starts
- **WebSocket subscription rooms:** `broadcast(data, projectId?)` filters by project, client subscribes via message
- **Lobby "Resume last project":** localStorage persistence for quick project re-entry
- **ADR-040:** Project-scoped dashboard architecture
- **ADR-041:** Muster review amendments (17 agents, 3 waves, 14 findings)
- **21 new tests:** project-scope (5), router-params (3), dashboard-data (13)
- **Legacy backward-compat routes:** Old `/api/danger-room/*` and `/api/war-room/*` paths still work via shim routes

### Changed

- All 13 Danger Room + 7 War Room routes moved to `/api/projects/:id/*` with access control
- Financial paths parameterized via `active*()` functions in heartbeat daemon
- Dashboard-data.ts functions accept `logsDir`/`projectDir` params (removed broken `PROJECT_ROOT` constant)
- Lobby navigation goes to project dashboard (not directly to Tower)
- WebSocket upgrade handlers check auth in LAN mode (was remote-only)
- TREASURY_DIR consolidated from 4 separate definitions to 1 source of truth

### Fixed

- **RBAC bypass on freeze endpoint:** Viewer could freeze daemons (deployer+ check added)
- **LAN WebSocket auth gap:** Upgrade handlers now check `isRemoteMode() || isLanMode()`
- **Global token fallback removed:** Freeze endpoint returns 503 if per-project token missing
- **Stale directory detection:** resolveProject() verifies project directory exists on disk
- **Prepack pattern sync:** docs/patterns/financial-transaction.ts synced with wizard version

### Security

- Project access control (`checkProjectAccess()`) enforced on all 20 dashboard routes
- WebSocket subscription rooms prevent cross-project data leakage
- Deployer role check on freeze endpoint (defense in depth alongside ROUTE_ROLES)
- Per-project daemon token isolation (no global token fallback)

---

## [21.0.0] - 2026-04-08

### Breaking Changes — The Extraction (ADR-038)

The wizard is now a standalone npm package. Projects contain methodology only.

- **Monorepo structure:** `packages/voidforge/` (wizard+CLI) and `packages/methodology/` (@voidforge/methodology)
- **CLI router:** `npx voidforge` with 12 commands (init, update, install, uninstall, deploy, doctor, migrate, version, templates, help)
- **.voidforge marker file:** JSON identity file at project root for CLI detection
- **Project creation:** `npx voidforge init --headless` creates projects with methodology copy, identity injection, marker, git init
- **Extension system:** `npx voidforge install <ext>` for danger-room (config) and cultivation (heartbeat, 12 jobs, treasury)
- **Update mechanisms:** `npx voidforge update` replaces `/void` git-fetch with methodology diff/apply preserving CLAUDE.md identity
- **Daemon aggregator:** Multi-project heartbeat connection, aggregated KPIs, freeze/unfreeze
- **v20.x migration:** `npx voidforge migrate` with backup, rollback, dry-run
- **Tests:** 675 (618 original + 57 new across 7 modules)

### Post-Campaign Tasks

- [ ] npm account creation for publishing
- [ ] Deprecation commits on scaffold/core branches
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline for npm publish on git tag
- [ ] Build pipeline (tsc compile to dist/) for production distribution

---

## [20.2.0] - 2026-04-03

### Added
- **ADR-037: Graceful Tier Degradation** — sentinel file check, methodology-only fallback, --audit-only expansion, cultivation graceful skip, phantom directory cleanup.
- **PRD-graceful-degradation.md** — 6 requirements for scaffold /cultivation and /grow experience.
- **Spring Cleaning migration** in `/void` — auto-cleans leaked main-only files from old scaffold/core clones. Fingerprints ambiguous files before removing. Detects Full-tier wizard usage.
- **GROWTH_STRATEGIST.md "Scaffold/Core Users"** section — documents which /grow phases work without wizard.
- **TROUBLESHOOTING.md** — Step 0 (What Changed?), Hypothesis Invalidation, Post-Deploy Debugging Protocol. (Field reports #271, #275)
- **QA_ENGINEER.md** — Stateful Service Audit: verify runtime state survives restart. (Field report #271)
- **SECURITY_AUDITOR.md** — Verify Before Transact: read-back verification for >$100 irreversible operations. (Field report #271)
- **SYSTEMS_ARCHITECT.md** — Strategy Consolidation Check + Access Control Granularity in conflict checklist. (Field reports #273, #274)
- **GAUNTLET.md** — Troi Marketing Copy Drift Check in standard and Infinity rounds. (Field report #273)
- **execution-safety.ts** — Derive Don't Accumulate pattern + never raw transfer() to smart contracts. (Field reports #271, #274, #275)
- **relay.sh** — Transport pre-flight validation at daemon startup for all 3 transports. (Field report #276)
- **BACKEND_ENGINEER.md** — Stateless by Default: all runtime state must be reconstructable within one startup cycle. (Field report #274)

### Changed
- **Tier gate sentinel** — all 6 Full-tier commands (`/cultivation`, `/grow`, `/dangerroom`, `/treasury`, `/portfolio`, `/current`) check `wizard/server.ts` not `wizard/` directory. Prevents phantom empty directories from bypassing the gate.
- **/grow Prerequisites** — "On no" proceeds to Phases 1-3 instead of hard stopping. `--audit-only`, `--seo`, `--content` skip the wizard gate entirely.
- **/cultivation install** — Steps 4-8 display skip messages when wizard absent. Step 7 shows partial install summary. "On no" proceeds to Steps 1-3.
- **/grow --audit-only** — expanded from Phase 1 to Phases 1-3 (reconnaissance + foundation + content).
- **.gitignore** — hardened with keys/certs, coverage, playwright reports, editor backups, settings.json, package-lock.json patterns. `wizard/` added on scaffold/core.
- **ROADMAP.md** — header updated to v20.2.0.
- **package.json** — replaced with minimal version on scaffold (name + version + description only, no dependencies).

### Removed
- **274 files** from scaffold branch — wizard/ (216 files), build configs, main-only scripts, stale v15.2.1 docs, wizard-specific ADRs (32), PRD-VOIDFORGE, PROPHECY, WORKSHOP, marketing copy, package-lock.json. Scaffold: 408 → 134 tracked files.
- **16 files** from core branch — same categories. Added 3 methodology-relevant ADRs (008, 032, 034).
- **20 residual wizard files** from scaffold (UI + headless-deploy.ts from earlier incomplete cleanup).
- **6 field reports closed** — #271 (debugging protocol), #272 (LEARNINGS validated), #273 (marketing drift), #274 (stateless + strategy), #275 (merged with #271), #276 (thumper tmux — 1 accept, 3 wontfix).

---

## [20.1.1] - 2026-04-02

### Changed
- **Parallel Agent Standard** added to `SUB_AGENTS.md` — standard brief format, structured deliverables, 3-agent concurrency cap, orchestration loop. Main thread orchestrates, sub-agents do the work. Dispatch directives added to ASSEMBLER.md (Rule 11), GAUNTLET.md, BUILD_PROTOCOL.md, CAMPAIGN.md, QA_ENGINEER.md, SECURITY_AUDITOR.md, CONTEXT_MANAGEMENT.md.
- **ID Space Audit** added to `QA_ENGINEER.md` — verify identifier comparisons use the same ID type.
- **Safety Parameter Audit** added to `SECURITY_AUDITOR.md` — verify safety-critical params can't be overridden to unsafe values.
- **Maul re-probe** formalized as mandatory gate in `ASSEMBLER.md` — review fixes can introduce new failure modes.

---

## [20.1.0] - 2026-04-02

### Added
- **Kongo Engine integration** (10 modules, 119 tests) — first-party landing page system for `/cultivation` and `/grow`. Typed HTTP client, page CRUD, campaign/variant management, AI variant generation, growth signal computation (two-proportion z-test), webhook HMAC verification, API key provisioning, PRD-to-seed extraction, heartbeat daemon jobs. Architecture: ADR-036.
- **`docs/patterns/kongo-integration.ts`** (37th pattern) — client, from-PRD generation, growth signal, webhook handling, daemon jobs.
- **`docs/LEARNINGS.md`** — first use of the Operational Learnings system (ADR-035). 3 initial entries from the Kongo build.
- **GROWTH_STRATEGIST.md Phase 3.5** — Kongo page generation between Content and Distribution phases. Content Engine section with 3-phase activation model, integration classification, weekly feedback loop, Wayne testLayer: 'page'.
- **HEARTBEAT.md Kongo jobs** — kongo-signal (hourly), kongo-seed (on winner), kongo-webhook (event-driven).
- **GAUNTLET.md** — Vin (Analytics) statistical review agent in Round 2 First Strike.
- **CAMPAIGN.md** — hard Gauntlet gate in Step 6, L-scope review scaling in Step 4, Kenobi quick-scan for auth/crypto missions, cross-mission data handoff check, blitz validation clarification.
- **PRD_GENERATOR.md** — external API doc reading requirement before writing data models.
- **BUILD_PROTOCOL.md** — stored value rename check, worker env verification checkpoint.
- **BACKEND_ENGINEER.md** — optimized path fallback rule.
- **AI_INTELLIGENCE.md** — token limit headroom rule, prohibition placement guidance.
- **FORGE_KEEPER.md** — Radagast description accuracy check in Step 4.
- **LESSONS.md** — muster semantic briefing lesson.

### Fixed
- **Growth signal control selection** (Gauntlet CRITICAL) — was using worst variant as baseline, now uses first variant by creation order (order=0) with deterministic tiebreaker.
- **Z-test confidence computation** (Gauntlet CRITICAL) — was using normalCdf as confidence; now computes proper one-tailed p-value (confidence = 1 - pValue).
- **Poll timeout** (Gauntlet CRITICAL) — was 120s for 2-10 min generation; now 660s.
- **Webhook future timestamp bypass** (Gauntlet HIGH) — rejects timestamps >60s in future.
- **Response body credential leak** (Gauntlet HIGH) — raw response body removed from error messages.
- **Response body DoS** (Gauntlet HIGH) — 10 MB size limit on HTTP responses.
- **Pagination infinite loop** (Gauntlet HIGH) — bounded to 20 pages max in batch campaign status.
- **Authorization header override** (Gauntlet HIGH) — case-insensitive sanitization prevents extraHeaders from overriding auth.
- **seedPush no-op** (Gauntlet HIGH) — now returns winning slot values instead of discarding.
- **Frontmatter delimiter guard** (Gauntlet HIGH) — missing closing delimiter treated as no frontmatter.
- **Z-test NaN guard** (Gauntlet HIGH) — catches views=0, se=NaN via `!(se > 0)`.
- **ADR-036 stale endpoints** — implementation status table replaces hypothetical endpoint list.

### Security
- Webhook HMAC: future timestamp bypass closed, body size limit (1 MB) added.
- HTTP client: response body size limit (10 MB), credential leak removed from errors, auth header override prevention, double-reject settled flag.

---

## [19.5.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- **`/blueprint` command** (28th slash command) — fourth entry path for users with pre-written specs. Validates PRD frontmatter, discovers supporting documents, merges project directives into CLAUDE.md, runs conflict scan, hands off to campaign.
- **Document discovery module** (`wizard/lib/document-discovery.ts`) — Wong scans for PRD, project directives, operations playbook, ADRs, and reference materials following Blueprint Path convention.
- **CLAUDE.md merge utility** (`wizard/lib/claude-merge.ts`) — safe idempotent append of project-specific directives. Never replaces methodology. Includes unmerge for re-merging with updated directives.
- **PRD structural validator** (`wizard/lib/prd-validator.ts`) — Troi's compliance checks (section detection, conditional rules based on frontmatter) + Picard's conflict scan (auth+database, payments+auth, workers+deploy, cache+deploy, admin+auth).
- **Blueprint API endpoint** (`wizard/api/blueprint.ts`) — detect, validate, and merge routes registered with wizard server for auto-detection.
- **Wizard auto-detection** — detects existing `docs/PRD.md` when transitioning from Step 3 to Step 4, offers "Use my blueprint" or "Start fresh" choice.
- **PRD template** (`docs/templates/PRD-TEMPLATE.md`) — complete frontmatter field reference with all required and optional fields.
- **`/prd --import`** flag — import and validate an existing PRD without running the interview.
- **`language` and `description`** fields added to `PrdFrontmatter` interface.
- **45 new tests** — document discovery (12), CLAUDE.md merge (11), PRD validator (22).

### Fixed
- **Path traversal** (Gauntlet CRITICAL) — blueprint merge endpoint validates `directivesPath` does not escape project root.
- **Typo** `executeBluprintMerge` → `executeBlueprintMerge`.
- **Blueprint API routes registered** with wizard server (were exported but never mounted).
- **Wizard dead-end flow** — "Use my blueprint" now shows validation results inline instead of `alert()` dead-end.
- **Blueprint banner colors** — uses theme accent (`#5b5bf7`) instead of mismatched gold (`#e2b714`).
- **`workers` negation inconsistency** — `scanConflicts` now checks `!== 'none'` consistently with `validatePrdStructure`.

---

## [19.4.0] - 2026-03-30

### Added
- **Campaign adapter directory** `wizard/lib/financial/campaign/` — new adapter category for campaign CRUD operations
- **Sandbox campaign adapter** — full lifecycle (create → pending_review → active → paused → resumed → completed) with realistic fake metrics (CTR 1.2-3.8%, CPC $0.45-$2.10, ROAS 1.5-4.2x), idempotency keys, deleted-campaign guards
- **Google Ads campaign adapter** — Campaign CRUD via Google Ads API v17, GAQL queries, 15k ops/day rate limiting
- **Meta Marketing campaign adapter** — Campaign CRUD via Graph API v19.0, 200 calls/hr rate limiting
- **TikTok Marketing campaign adapter** — Campaign CRUD via Marketing API v1.3, 10 calls/sec rate limiting
- **Campaign adapter factory** `getCampaignAdapter()` — config-driven instantiation with cached sandbox fallback per platform
- **5 heartbeat handlers wired** — handleCampaignLaunch, handleCampaignPause, handleCampaignResume, handleBudgetChange, handleCreativeUpdate now call real platform adapters
- **Campaign status polling** — every 5 minutes, polls adapter.getPerformance() for live metrics (spend, CTR, CPC, ROAS), enriches campaign records for Danger Room display
- **Circuit breaker** — 3 consecutive adapter failures marks platform degraded
- **48 new tests** — sandbox adapter (30), platform adapters (19), heartbeat handlers (13), campaign polling (7) — minus existing, net +48 (406 → 454)

### Changed
- **Freeze handler** pauses ALL active campaigns across ALL platforms via adapter.pauseCampaign(), transitions to `suspended`
- **Unfreeze handler** resumes ALL suspended campaigns via adapter.resumeCampaign()
- **Freeze returns 207** on partial failure (previously always 200)
- **Token refresh** now calls adapter.refreshToken() instead of logging

### Fixed
- **GAQL injection** (Victory Gauntlet CRITICAL) — sanitize all query parameters in Google campaign adapter
- **Path traversal** (Victory Gauntlet CRITICAL) — validate campaignId format before file I/O
- **Sandbox adapter ephemeral** (Victory Gauntlet CRITICAL) — cache instances per platform so campaign state persists between operations
- **Budget validation** — reject negative, NaN, Infinity, non-integer values
- **WAL entry** for budget changes (ADR-3 compliance)
- **Idempotency keys** on Meta and TikTok createCampaign (previously missing)
- **Compliance guard** on all 3 platform adapters
- **BUDGET_EXCEEDED** error mapping on all 3 platforms

### Removed
- **5 VG-R1-006 stub handlers** returning 501 — all replaced with full implementations
- **Stale VG-R1-006 comment** on reconciliation handler (already wired)

---

## [19.3.0] - 2026-03-30

### Added
- **Multi-Environment Isolation** — 8-point checklist in DEVOPS_ENGINEER.md: separate users, credentials, storage, Redis auth, worktree model, git hooks, Docker port audit, staging-first flow (field report #241)
- **4 testing anti-patterns** in TESTING.md — error format migration checklist, source-code string assertions, standalone test app handler, version-agnostic assertions (field report #227)
- **HTML Sanitizer Preservation** section in BACKEND_ENGINEER.md — DOMPurify client-fallback detection (field report #228)
- **Schema.sql sync gate** in BUILD_PROTOCOL.md Phase 12 — IF NOT EXISTS post-processing, reference file freshness (field reports #232, #242)
- **Tenant isolation completeness** gate in CAMPAIGN.md Victory — campaign-level org_id sweep (field report #229)
- **Dead code discovery** in GAUNTLET.md Round 1 Kusanagi — dead API method scan (field report #233)
- **Cross-environment contamination** check in GAUNTLET.md Round 1 — shared credentials, Docker bypass (field report #241)
- **System Protocol identity headers** on 8 utility docs (BUILD_PROTOCOL, BUILD_JOURNAL, CONTEXT_MANAGEMENT, MCP_INTEGRATION, MUSTER, PRD_GENERATOR, SUB_AGENTS, TROUBLESHOOTING)
- **5 undocumented patterns** now in CLAUDE.md — ad-billing-adapter.ts, browser-review.ts, e2e-test.ts, funding-plan.ts, stablecoin-adapter.ts (35 total)

### Changed
- **Confidence scoring** deduplicated — 3 agent docs (UX, QA, Security) now cross-reference GAUNTLET.md with low-confidence escalation rule intact
- **RC-STUB** detection expanded — else/default branches flagged as most commonly missed variant (field report #230)
- **Pattern count** in Docs Reference table corrected from 32 to 35

### Fixed
- **22 field reports triaged** on tmcleod3/voidforge — 14 informational closed, 8 actionable with 13 fixes applied, all 22 closed
- **Assessment findings** reduced from 18 (v16.1.0) to 0 (v19.3.0) — all Critical and High resolved

## [19.2.0] - 2026-03-26

### Added
- **TikTok billing adapter** — spend monitoring, debit projection, MONITORED_ONLY classification via Marketing API
- **AdPlatform type widened** — `google | meta` → 7-platform union (future-proof)
- **5 new TikTok billing tests** — capability detection, spend projection, normalized state

### Changed
- **Adapter extensibility proven** — adding a new billing platform: 3 files, same pattern every time

## [19.1.0] - 2026-03-26

### Added
- **Adapter factory** (`adapter-factory.ts`) — config-driven adapter selection. Reads `funding-config.json.enc` from vault, returns Circle/Mercury/Google/Meta real adapters or sandbox fallback. Zero hard-coded adapter instantiations.
- **Auto-funding execution** — approved funding plans from `funding-plans.jsonl` now automatically execute off-ramps via the adapter factory. Plan lifecycle: APPROVED → PENDING_SETTLEMENT → SETTLED.
- **WAL recovery** — daemon startup reads `pending-ops.jsonl` and resumes incomplete operations.
- **WAL rotation** — 7-file rotation on `pending-ops.jsonl` (same pattern as audit-log).
- **66 new financial tests** — funding-policy (22), reconciliation-engine (17), platform-planner (15), sandbox-stablecoin (12). Total: 314 → 380.

### Fixed
- **Billing jobs wired** — Google invoice scan and Meta debit monitor now read real data via adapter factory (were no-ops returning immediately)
- **`pendingObligationsCents` populated** — runway forecast now includes real invoice/debit obligations (was hardcoded to 0)
- **CB-4/CB-5 invocable** — billing circuit breakers now called from billing jobs (were dead code)
- **Mercury wired** — bank-settlement-monitor reads real bank balance via adapter factory (was never populated)
- **Circle stable IDs** — `listCompletedTransfers` uses Circle payout ID, not random UUID (was breaking reconciliation)
- **Sandbox unknown transfer** — `getTransferStatus` returns 'failed' for unknown IDs (was returning 'completed' with 0 amount)

## [19.0.0] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- **Stablecoin Ad Funding Rail** — complete USDC → Circle off-ramp → Mercury bank → Google/Meta billing pipeline
- **3 new pattern files** — `stablecoin-adapter.ts` (511 lines), `ad-billing-adapter.ts` (537 lines), `funding-plan.ts` (462 lines). 35 patterns total.
- **`wizard/lib/financial/` directory** — 14 modules: stablecoin adapters (Circle real + sandbox), Mercury bank adapter, Google/Meta billing adapters, treasury planner, funding policy engine (7 rules), reconciliation engine (3-way matching), auto-funding evaluator, platform planner (invoice settlement + debit protection + portfolio rebalancing), reporting (daily markdown + monthly JSON + funding simulation), registries
- **Circle adapter** — real `node:https` against Circle Business Account API v1 (balance, off-ramp, transfer lifecycle)
- **Mercury adapter** — real `node:https` against Mercury API v1 (balance, transactions)
- **Google Ads billing adapter** — billing setup detection, invoice reads, settlement instructions, capability classification
- **Meta Ads billing adapter** — funding source classification, debit projection, direct debit tracking
- **Sandbox stablecoin adapter** — $50K simulated USDC balance, 3-poll transfer lifecycle
- **8 new heartbeat daemon jobs** — stablecoin balance, off-ramp poll, settlement monitor, Google invoice scan, Meta debit monitor, runway forecast, funding reconciliation, stale plan detector
- **6 treasury socket handlers** — /treasury/offramp (vault+TOTP), /treasury/freeze, /treasury/unfreeze (vault+TOTP), /treasury/balances, /treasury/funding-status, /treasury/runway
- **6 circuit breakers** — provider down (3 polls), SLA breach (24h), recon mismatch (2 consecutive), invoice coverage shortfall, debit failure, daily cap ($50K)
- **Danger Room funding intelligence** — Growth tab (runway + funding risk + next event), Treasury tab (USDC balance + pending + bank + invoices + reconciliation + freeze state), Campaigns tab (billing capability per platform), Heartbeat tab (funding ops)
- **20 treasury-planner tests** — runway, offramp triggers, plan generation, spend forecasting

### Changed
- **Method docs** updated: TREASURY.md (stablecoin section + 9 commands), HEARTBEAT.md (8 jobs + 5 states), GROWTH_STRATEGIST.md (billing capability verification)
- **Command docs** updated: cultivation.md (stablecoin option), grow.md (billing checks), treasury.md (crypto commands)
- **Heartbeat daemon** extended with treasury module — backward compatible (stablecoin gated on config)
- **HeartbeatState** interface extended with 5 optional treasury fields

## [18.2.0] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed
- **A11y heading hierarchy** — `<h3>` → `<h2>` in index.html (3 headings) and deploy.html (2 headings) to maintain proper hierarchy under `<h1>`
- **Semantic headings in dashboards** — 40 `.panel-title` divs changed to `<h2>` in danger-room.html (29) and war-room.html (11) for screen reader navigation landmarks
- **Tower CDN fallback** — When xterm.js fails to load from CDN (offline/air-gapped), tower page now shows a helpful message instead of silently breaking

### Security (verified clean)
- All 7 pages return correct security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, CORS, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy)
- CSRF protection verified: POST without X-VoidForge-Request returns 403
- Directory traversal verified: `../../etc/passwd` returns 404
- No stack traces or internal paths exposed on any page

## [18.1.0] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- **`browser-review.ts` pattern** (32nd pattern) — Review browser launcher with network isolation, console error capture with noise filtering, page state capture (screenshot + a11y + headings), responsive capture (3 viewports), behavioral walkthrough (click all buttons, fill all forms), security inspection (cookies, CORS, CSP)
- **QA Step 3.6 "Browser Forensic Review"** — console error sweep, error state gallery (force API failures + screenshot), form torture (empty/max/unicode/XSS), network failure simulation
- **UX Browser-Assisted Walkthrough** — proof-of-life screenshots, behavioral verification (click + verify response), form interaction, keyboard walkthrough, responsive proof-of-life at 3 viewports. Samwise browser a11y with axe-core + color scheme emulation.
- **Security browser checks expanded** — cookie inspection via `inspectCookies()`, CORS verification via `captureCORSHeaders()`, CSP violation capture via `captureCSPViolations()`, auth redirect verification, mixed content detection
- **Gauntlet Hawkeye R2.5 Browser Intelligence** — console error capture, proof-of-life screenshots shared with Round 2 agents, cookie/CORS inspection forwarded to Kenobi

### Changed
- Agents now interact with running applications during review passes — console errors, behavioral walkthroughs, and security inspection reduce human eyeball dependency. Screenshots are evidence (not design review — Riker's dissent adopted from the Muster).

## [18.0.0] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- **Playwright E2E testing infrastructure** — `@playwright/test` + `@axe-core/playwright` with network isolation, test port 3199, VOIDFORGE_TEST mode, separate CI job with browser caching
- **21 E2E tests** across 4 test files: lobby (empty state, keyboard nav, modal, a11y), login (form, validation, a11y), setup wizard (load, input, a11y, keyboard), danger room (5-tab navigation, growth empty state, a11y), deploy (load, a11y), tower (UI shell), war room (load)
- **`e2e-test.ts` pattern file** — Page Object Model, axe-core fixture, auth helper, network mock, WebSocket mock, CWV measurement, flaky test protocol, framework adaptations (Next.js, Express, Django, Rails)
- **Browser verification in 6 method docs** — QA (Batman browser verification + Huntress flaky monitoring), UX (Samwise browser a11y + Éowyn enchantment verification + Gimli CWV), Gauntlet (Hawkeye R2.5 browser smoke + Troi browser PRD compliance), Build Protocol (Playwright in Phase 1/4/9-11), Security (5 browser-based checks), DevOps (E2E CI architecture)
- **TESTING.md E2E section** — testing pyramid position, 2-min performance budget, flaky test protocol, sharding guidance
- **PRD frontmatter `e2e` field** — `yes | no`, defaults by project type

### Changed
- **CI pipeline** expanded from typecheck + unit tests to include a separate Playwright E2E job (parallel, Chromium-only, cached browsers)
- **VOIDFORGE_TEST mode** — rate limit bypass, TOTP 000000 accept, self-start on PORT env var (for test isolation)

## [17.3.0] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- **`--muster` flag** — Full 9-universe agent deployment in 3 waves (Vanguard → Main Force → Adversarial). Available on `/architect`, `/campaign`, `/build`, `/gauntlet`. 30-50 agents for decisions that matter. See `docs/methods/MUSTER.md`.
- **`MUSTER.md` method doc** — Reusable protocol: beacons, muster roll, the ride, the council. 40+ agents mapped with inclusion criteria.
- **Flag taxonomy in CLAUDE.md** — 3-tier system: Universal (--resume, --plan, --fast, --dry-run, --status, --blitz), Scope (--security-only, --ux-only, --qa-only), Intensity (--fast < standard < --muster < --infinity)

### Changed
- **`--quick` renamed to `--fast`** on Gauntlet for cross-command consistency (deprecated alias noted)
- **`--plan` added** to `/architect` and `/grow`
- **`--status`** standardized as flag (not subcommand) on `/cultivation`, `/dangerroom`, `/thumper`
- **`--dry-run` added** to `/treasury`, `/grow`, `/git`
- **`--blitz` added** to `/assemble` and `/build`
- **`--resume` added** to `/build`

## [17.2.0] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- **101 new security tests** for 7 P0 modules: totp (14), tower-session (20), tower-rate-limit (9), user-manager (16), compliance (12), treasury-backup (7), autonomy-controller (23). Total: 193 → 294.

### Fixed
- **TypeScript mock type error** in stripe-adapter.test.ts — `req.end` mock now returns req for ClientRequest compatibility. `tsc --noEmit` clean.

## [17.1.0] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- **3 new test files** — stripe-adapter (9 tests: mocked HTTPS, error handling), heartbeat-data (10 tests: file-based campaign/treasury reads), audit-log (7 tests: rotation cascade, no-throw). Total: 167 → 193.
- **3 ADRs** — ADR-032 (No Stubs Doctrine), ADR-033 (Sandbox Demo Pipeline), ADR-034 (Raw HTTPS for External APIs)
- **TypeScript CI** — `npm run typecheck` added to validate-branches.yml before tests

### Fixed
- **Timing-safe vault comparison** — HMAC both inputs to fixed-size digests before `timingSafeEqual` (no more password length leak via timing)
- **Negative spend clamping** — `Math.max(0, ...)` on spend log entries prevents negative amountCents from producing nonsensical ROAS
- **Inverted date range handling** — sandbox adapters return empty results instead of silently treating end-before-start as 1 day
- **IPv6 proxy shutdown** — stored at module level and closed in shutdown handler (was a dangling listener)
- **28 TypeScript errors** in pattern files — type-safe API response casts, removed unused @ts-expect-error, fixed session type in server.ts. `tsc --noEmit` now produces **0 errors**

### Changed
- **Sandbox campaigns Map** moved from module level to instance scope — prevents state leaks between tests and adapter instances
- `readCampaigns()` and `readTreasurySummary()` exported from heartbeat.ts for direct unit testing

## [17.0.0] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- **No Stubs Doctrine** — enforced across CLAUDE.md, BUILD_PROTOCOL, CAMPAIGN, GAUNTLET (RC-STUB), ARCHITECT (ADR scope), ASSESS, GROWTH_STRATEGIST, LESSONS. Never ship stub code again.
- **Sandbox ad platform adapter** — full implementation with realistic campaign data, spend tracking, performance metrics. Enables Cultivation pipeline demo without real API credentials.
- **Sandbox bank adapter** — full implementation with realistic transactions and balances for treasury demo.
- **Stripe revenue adapter** — real Stripe API integration via `node:https` (zero new dependencies). connect, getTransactions, getBalance. Free test mode supported.
- **Danger Room growth tabs** — 4 new tabs: #growth (KPI cards), #campaigns (campaign table), #treasury (vault + budget status), #heartbeat (daemon + token health). 30-second auto-refresh.
- **Implementation Completeness Policy** (PRD §8.1) — formal policy codifying the No Stubs Doctrine
- **74 new tests** — financial-vault (13), reconciliation (11), campaign-state-machine (33), sandbox-adapter (17). Total: 93 → 167.

### Changed
- **Heartbeat daemon wired to real data** — readCampaigns() reads treasury/campaigns/*.json, readTreasurySummary() reads spend/revenue JSONL logs, all 8 scheduled jobs perform real reads and meaningful logging
- **Heartbeat handlers return 501** (honest "not yet wired") instead of 200 (fake success) for campaign pause/resume/launch/budget — No Stubs Doctrine enforcement
- **Adapter registry** tracks `implemented: true/false` per platform and `REVENUE_ADAPTERS` registry added
- **PRD counts corrected** — 260+ agents (was 185+), 30 patterns (was 10), 17 leads (was 15), 9 universes (was 8)
- **PRD roadmap collapsed** — shipped versions (v4-v16.1) summarized, v17.0 + v17.1+ plan added

### Fixed
- **X-Forwarded-For parsing** — use leftmost entry (real client IP) not rightmost (proxy 127.0.0.1). Rate limiting and session IP binding were completely broken in remote mode.
- **Local mode loopback binding** — bind to `127.0.0.1` + `::1` proxy instead of `::` (IPv6 wildcard). Prevents LAN exposure of vault data. (PRD §9.20.1)
- **Vault unlock rate limiting** — use getClientIp() instead of req.socket.remoteAddress. All users shared one rate limit bucket behind proxy.
- **Freeze endpoint** — wired to daemon Unix socket with auth token instead of returning fake `{ ok: true }`. Requires deployer RBAC.
- **AWS credential validation** — calls STS.GetCallerIdentity (SDK already a dependency) instead of format-only check
- **TOCTOU race in auth setup** — removed outer hasUsers() check, rely on createUser()'s serialized atomic check
- **Audit log 7-rotation** — retains .1 through .7 instead of single .1 that lost financial audit trail
- **auth.json backup-before-write** — prevents remote mode lockout on corruption
- **/api/server/status** — registered via addRoute() for auth middleware coverage in remote mode
- **Treasury backup size limit** — 100MB per file to prevent unbounded memory allocation
- **Missing await on buildStateSnapshot()** — heartbeat.json was writing `{}` instead of real state
- **Stripe error handling** — non-JSON error responses (proxy 502) no longer cause SyntaxError
- **Sandbox adapter type alignment** — return types match pattern interfaces (externalId, spend, platform, scopes)

### Removed
- **8 stub adapter files deleted** — meta.ts, google.ts, tiktok.ts, linkedin.ts, twitter.ts, reddit.ts, mercury.ts, brex.ts (610 lines, 77 `throw new Error('Implement...')` calls). Per No Stubs Doctrine: real adapters ship when developer accounts are available (v17.1+).
- **Dead getClientIp** from tower-rate-limit.ts — single source of truth in tower-auth.ts

### Security
- Freeze endpoint requires `deployer` role minimum (was accessible to any authenticated user)
- 3 P0 fixes verified by Kenobi: XFF parsing, loopback binding, vault rate limit IP

## [16.1.0] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- **Database migration safety** — `database-migration.ts` pattern (backward-compat, batched ops, rollback, zero-downtime validation) + Migration Safety Gate checklist in BUILD_PROTOCOL.md Phase 2
- **Data pipeline pattern** — `data-pipeline.ts` (typed stages, checkpoint/resume, quality checks, idempotent processing)
- **Backtest engine pattern** — `backtest-engine.ts` (walk-forward validation, no-lookahead enforcement, Sharpe/drawdown/profit factor, slippage/commission modeling)
- **Execution safety pattern** — `execution-safety.ts` (order validation, position limits, exchange precision from API, paper/live toggle, circuit breaker, reconciliation, audit trail)
- **Branch CI validation** — `.github/workflows/validate-branches.yml` validates all 3 branches on push (command files, method docs, pattern files, VERSION.md)
- **PRD frontmatter** — `type: "quantitative"`, `data_source`, `backtest`, `live_execution`, `ai:` fields

### Changed
- **Dependency health check** added to `/assess` (Crusher) and `/campaign` Step 0 (Kira): auto-check if project >30 days stale
- **Load testing guidance** added to DEVOPS_ENGINEER.md: when/what/tools/diagnostics
- Pattern count: 26 → 30 across CLAUDE.md, README.md, HOLOCRON.md, patterns/README.md
- **Personality section** added to CLAUDE.md: never agree just to agree, challenge when appropriate

## [16.0.0] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- **Foundation universe (Isaac Asimov)** — 9th universe, 13 named agents for the AI Intelligence domain
- **Hari Seldon** — 18th lead agent, AI Intelligence Architect. Owns: model selection, prompt engineering, tool-use schemas, orchestration patterns, failure modes, token economics, evaluation, AI safety, model versioning, LLM observability
- **`/ai` command** — Seldon's AI Intelligence Audit: 5-phase protocol (Surface Map → Parallel Audits → Sequential Audits → Remediate → Re-Verify)
- **`AI_INTELLIGENCE.md`** — Full method doc with 12 sub-agents, 10 operating rules, 5 checklists, 8 anti-patterns
- **6 AI pattern files** — `ai-orchestrator.ts` (agent loops, circuit breaker), `ai-classifier.ts` (confidence thresholds, fallback chains), `ai-router.ts` (intent routing), `prompt-template.ts` (versioned prompts), `ai-eval.ts` (golden datasets, regression detection), `ai-tool-schema.ts` (typed tools, provider adapters)
- **7th Gauntlet Stone: Wisdom** — AI Intelligence domain in comprehensive review
- **PRD frontmatter** — `ai: yes`, `ai_provider`, `ai_models`, `ai_features` fields

### Changed
- **8 existing commands** integrated with Seldon's AI layer: `/build` (AI Gate at Phase 4), `/gauntlet` (7th Stone + Crossfire + Council), `/assemble` (Phase 6.5), `/campaign` (5th requirement type), `/security` (Bliss handoff), `/qa` (AI Behavior Testing), `/architect` (Seldon Review), `/prd` (AI Architecture section)
- Agent counts: 247 → 260+, 8 → 9 universes, 25 → 26 commands, 20 → 26 patterns, 17 → 18 leads

## [15.3.0] - 2026-03-23

## [15.2.1] - 2026-03-23

### Changed
- **GAUNTLET.md** — Added Dimension 4 (output verification) to Sibling Verification Protocol: verify fixes against real output data to catch false positives in keyword filters (#148)
- **CAMPAIGN.md** — Victory condition now includes deploy entrypoint verification: confirm Docker CMD / PM2 ecosystem runs the built architecture, not a legacy file (#147)
- **BUILD_PROTOCOL.md** — Phase 12 Docker smoke test: mandatory check that container entrypoint runs new code before go-live (#147)
- **DEVOPS_ENGINEER.md** — First deployment checklist: process manager, env vars, log directory, health endpoint, entrypoint verification (#147)

### Added
- **LESSONS.md** — 3 new lessons: read-before-export (verify source exports before re-exporting), read-before-test (read implementation before writing expectations), numeric context checks (cite actual % from /context)

## [15.2.0] - 2026-03-23

### Changed
- **tower-auth.ts** split into 3 modules: tower-auth (424 lines — auth core), tower-session (149 lines — sessions/cookies), tower-rate-limit (87 lines — rate limiting). All exports re-exported for backward compatibility.
- **aws-vps.ts** — SSH security group restricted to deployer's IP post-provisioning (detects IP via checkip.amazonaws.com, revokes 0.0.0.0/0 rule)
- **ProvisionEvent.status** type now includes `'warning'` for non-fatal alerts

## [15.1.0] - 2026-03-23

### Added
- **vitest** test framework with `--pool forks` isolation — 91 tests across 8 files (vault, body-parser, tower-auth, network, frontmatter, instance-sizing, safety-tiers, http-helpers)
- **Vault unlock rate limiting** — 5 attempts/min, lockout after 10 consecutive failures (separate from login rate limits)
- **Vault auto-lock** — 15-minute idle timeout clears session password
- **6 proxy modules** — financial-core, daemon-core, oauth-core, revenue-types, ad-platform-core, rate-limiter-core (breaks direct wizard/ → docs/patterns/ imports)
- **provisioner-registry.ts** — single source of truth for provisioners, credential scoping, GitHub-linked targets

### Changed
- **Terminal HMAC** — per-boot random 32-byte key replaces vault password as HMAC keying material
- **sendJson** consolidated from 10 duplicate definitions to 1 shared module in http-helpers.ts (with noCache support)
- **Health poller** — batch writes (N individual → 1 registry update per poll cycle)
- **TOTP clock skew** — prunes usedCodes when drift exceeds ±3 steps (prevents lockout after clock jump)

### Fixed
- **47 Infinity Gauntlet fixes** — provision lock deadlock, vault cache mutation, body-parser non-object bypass, terminal resize NaN crash, Docker healthcheck exec form, CI SSH key leak, RDS hardcoded 'admin', symlink security no-op, autonomy-controller crash safety, secret stripping keyword gaps, and 36 more across 21 files
- **Accessibility** — skip-nav + noscript on all 7 pages, aria-labelledby on deploy step 1

### Security
- Secret stripping expanded with allowlist (SAFE_OUTPUT_KEYS) — comprehensive keyword coverage without false positives
- Error message token regex lowered from 40+ to 16+ characters

---

## [15.0.0] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- **`/deploy` command** — Kusanagi's deploy agent with 6-step protocol: target detection (VPS/Vercel/Railway/Docker/Static/Cloudflare), pre-deploy checks (Levi), deploy execution, health check (L), rollback (Valkyrie), deploy-state.md logging
- **Campaign Step 7** — optional auto-deploy after Victory Gauntlet passes. Blitz mode auto-deploys. Deploy failure doesn't revoke Victory.
- **`/git --deploy` flag** — one-command commit + push + deploy. Coulson commits, Kusanagi deploys.
- **Deploy drift detector** — `GET /api/danger-room/drift` compares deployed commit against `git rev-parse HEAD`. Catches "pushed but not deployed" scenarios.
- **Deploy Automation** section in DEVOPS_ENGINEER.md — target detection, deploy state, campaign integration, rollback protocol

### Changed
- **Deploy panel** reads from `deploy-state.md` (v15.0 format) in addition to `deploy-log.json`

---

## [14.0.0] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- **Day-0 Cultivation onboarding** — 7-step guided install: treasury → revenue → ad platforms → budget → creatives → tracking → launch. No longer requires a deployed product.
- **`/grow --setup`** — standalone ad platform onboarding: guided credential collection for Google Ads, Meta, LinkedIn, Twitter, Reddit with per-platform best-fit guidance
- **Phase 4.5 Launch Preparation** — budget allocation (product-type-aware splits), creative foundation (6 variants via /imagine), tracking & attribution (pixel snippets + conversion events)
- **Launch activation flow** — summary presentation, user confirmation, platform submission, Danger Room Growth tab wiring
- **Pre-Revenue Setup** in TREASURY.md — budget tracking before first dollar, auto-detection of payment processors, absolute spend limits for pre-revenue projects

### Changed
- **Cultivation install no longer requires deployment** — "product should be deployed" prerequisite removed. Day-0 setup works pre-launch, launch day, and post-launch.
- **Growth Strategist operating rule 1** updated — product deployment required for Phase 1+ (reconnaissance), not for installation

---

## [13.1.0] - 2026-03-22

### Changed
- **Circular import broken** — `getServerPort`/`getServerHost` extracted to `wizard/lib/server-config.ts`, eliminating the `server.ts ↔ dashboard-ws.ts` cycle
- **CORS/CSP for LAN mode** — private IP origins accepted via `isPrivateOrigin()` in CORS; `ws://*:PORT` added to CSP `connect-src` for WebSocket
- **Context gauge always visible** — compact percentage indicator in header bar, color-coded, stays visible when scrolling past Tier 1
- **Private IP consolidation** — `health-poller.ts` now imports `isPrivateIp` from shared `network.ts` instead of inline checks

---

## [13.0.0] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- **LAN mode (`--lan`)** — Private network access for ZeroTier, Tailscale, WireGuard. Binds `0.0.0.0` with optional password, no TOTP/Caddy. Private IP validation covers RFC 1918, CGNAT (Tailscale), IPv6 ULA (ZeroTier).
- **Status Line bridge** — `scripts/danger-room-feed.sh` connects Claude Code's Status Line API to the Danger Room. Per-session files with atomic writes, 60-second staleness threshold. Powers context gauge + cost display.
- **Agent activity ticker** — Methodology-driven JSONL logging (not hooks). Hybrid `fs.watch` + 3-second poll fallback. Live agent dispatch events broadcast via WebSocket.
- **Tests panel** — Structured `test-results.json` data contract with defined schema. New `/api/danger-room/tests` endpoint.
- **Git status panel** — Branch, uncommitted count, ahead/behind, last commit via `execFile` with 5-second timeout. New `/api/danger-room/git-status` endpoint.
- **Dashboard config** — `danger-room.config.json` for project-specific panel settings (health endpoint, PM2 process, enabled panels).
- **Shared `wizard/lib/network.ts`** — `isPrivateIp()` + `isPrivateOrigin()` with numeric octet parsing. Consolidates duplicate implementations.

### Changed
- **3-tier information architecture** — Ops tab restructured: Live Feed (context gauge + agent ticker) → Campaign State (timeline + findings + pipeline) → System Status (version + deploy + tests). Visual hierarchy with tier labels and distinct styling.
- **Tiered polling** — Fast 5s (context), campaign 10s (timeline/findings), slow 60s (version/deploy). Replaces uniform 10-second poll. ~60% reduction in unnecessary network requests.
- **Dashboard consolidation** — 800+ lines of duplicated code extracted into 3 shared modules (`http-helpers.ts`, `dashboard-data.ts`, `dashboard-ws.ts`). danger-room.ts: 306→113 lines. war-room.ts: 248→67 lines.
- **War Room wired** — Routes now actually register (was dead code — never imported by server.ts).
- **Empty states** — Every panel shows actionable guidance when data is missing.

### Fixed
- **Campaign regex** — `parseCampaignState()` rewritten for actual 5-column format. Handles bold markdown status (`**DONE**`). Normalizes vocabulary. Extracts `blockedBy` + `debrief` fields.
- **Build state artifacts** — `parseBuildState()` explicit trim removes leading `| ` capture artifacts.
- **Findings counter** — `parseFindings()` reads `build-state.md` "Known Issues" first (curated, open issues only). Falls back to regex scan with defensive logging.

## [12.6.4] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- **Encryption Egress Audit** in security auditor — grep all usages of plaintext variable after encrypting, not just the storage path (DB, Redis, SSE, logs, API responses)
- **GROUP BY Compatibility Check** in security auditor — random-IV encryption breaks aggregation; add deterministic HMAC hash column
- **v14.0 roadmap** — The Day-0 Engine: Cultivation onboarding redesign with 7-step guided growth setup

### Fixed
- Field reports #130, #131 triaged — 2 security methodology fixes applied, 1 feature request roadmapped

---

## [12.6.3] - 2026-03-22

### Changed
- Campaign planning now **requires acceptance criteria** on every mission before the Prophecy Board is finalized — applies to `--plan` mode too, not just build
- Kira's Step 0 checks if `campaign-state.md` is **gitignored** and warns immediately — prevents silent data loss on `/clear`
- Kira's Step 0 includes a **pre-flight checklist**: VERSION.md, package manifest, campaign-state tracking, clean working tree

### Added
- `/architect --adr-only` lightweight mode — write ADRs without full bridge crew deployment, for deferred architecture decisions

### Fixed
- Field report #129 triaged — 4 fixes applied, 1 wontfix (--plan --draft solved by git diff)

---

## [12.6.2] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- **v13.0 roadmap** — The Private Network: `--lan` mode for ZeroTier/Tailscale/WireGuard access, context gauge wiring via Status Line bridge, 3 Danger Room bug fixes, 3 unwired feature plans, 4 new dashboard panel proposals from real-world usage (field reports #127, #128)

---

## [12.6.1] - 2026-03-22

### Changed
- Campaign Gauntlet checkpoints now extract **Learned Rules** — recurring root causes become pre-flight checks for subsequent missions, with escalation triggers (hardening sprints for >5 HIGH findings, auto-add missions for missing capabilities)
- Build Protocol Phase 0 validates data-dependent business cases against **historical data** before building infrastructure — no more blocking campaigns on live monitoring
- Campaign missions for data-dependent systems must re-run **regression test suites** when modifying strategy logic

### Added
- Iterative PRD evolution workflow documented for `/architect --plan` — multi-commit PRD refinement as a recognized pattern
- PRD Evolution Log section in PRD template for tracking architectural reasoning across iterations

### Fixed

- **`--assess` flag for `/gauntlet`** — Assessment-only mode: Rounds 1-2 (Discovery + First Strike), no fix batches. Produces report grouped by root cause. Designed for pre-build evaluation where full 10 rounds would be redundant.
- **Stub Detection** in QA_ENGINEER.md — Oracle scans for methods that return True/success without side effects (no network calls, no state writes). The most dangerous form of incomplete code. High severity; Critical for financial systems.
- **Migration Completeness Check** in BUILD_PROTOCOL.md Phase 1 — Before scaffolding, scan for duplicate implementations across directories. Abandoned migrations are flagged as blockers.
- **Auth-from-Day-One** in BUILD_PROTOCOL.md Phase 1 — HTTP endpoints require API key middleware returning 401 from birth. Full auth stays Phase 3, but the door is locked from day one.
- **Process Manager Discipline** in DEVOPS_ENGINEER.md — Never kill ports owned by PM2/systemd/Docker directly; always reload through the process manager.
- **Frontmatter Validation** in CAMPAIGN.md Step 1 — Before Dax analyzes the PRD, validate YAML frontmatter exists. If missing, Sisko runs a 5-question interview to add it.
- **VM execution test** in GAUNTLET.md build-output verification — Compiled JSX/HTML must be tested in the target runtime, not just built successfully.

### Fixed
- Field reports #123, #124, #125 triaged — 8 methodology improvements applied, all 3 issues closed

---

## [12.4.2] - 2026-03-19

- **Node.js `engines` field** tightened from `>=20.0.0` to `>=20.11.0` — `import.meta.dirname` requires 20.11+.
- **Quality Reduction Anti-Pattern** — hard methodology rule: agents MUST NOT reduce Gauntlet, checkpoint, or debrief quality based on self-assessed "context pressure." Must run `/context` and report actual usage. Below 70% = continue full protocol.
- **9 methodology fixes** from field reports #46-#53: CORS requirements check, external API HTTPS enforcement, IP range validation warning, internal path leakage check, client-side partial failure testing, const/let audit, Node API compatibility check, UI→server route tracing, Victory Checklist with debrief-before-sign-off.
- **CLAUDE.md** — added PRD_GENERATOR to Docs Reference, corrected pattern count (7→8).
- **Architecture docs** version headers updated to 8.0.0.

---

## [8.0.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- **Agent Memory — Active Lessons Read-Back.** Wong loads `/docs/LESSONS.md` during Phase 0 Orient. Review commands (`/qa`, `/security`, `/ux`, `/review`) read LESSONS.md in Context Setup and flag matches during analysis.
- **Conflict Prediction — Phase 0.5 Architecture Scan.** Picard scans PRD frontmatter for 8 structural contradictions before any code is written. Added Conflict Checklist to SYSTEMS_ARCHITECT.md and pre-analysis step to `/architect`.
- **`/prd` command** — Sisko's PRD generator. 5-act structured interview producing a complete PRD with valid YAML frontmatter.

---

## [7.7.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- **Native module mtime detection** — server snapshots `.node` file mtimes at startup, checks on Lobby load. If changed (npm install while server running), shows "Restart Now" banner.
- **`/api/server/status` endpoint** — returns `needsRestart` flag for native module detection.
- **`docs/COMPATIBILITY.md`** — Node.js version testing doc with known ABI-breaking changes and engines field policy.
- **Restart banner** in Lobby — appears when native modules changed on disk.

### Changed
- **ARCHITECTURE.md** rewritten from v2.7.0 to v7.7.0 — adds Avengers Tower, RBAC, Thumper, ws/node-pty, PTY manager, vault key naming, mtime detection.
- **FAILURE_MODES.md** rewritten — adds WebSocket, PTY, Tower, Thumper, and native module failure modes.
- **SCALING.md** rewritten — Tier 2 reflects shipped multi-user features, PTY sessions as bottleneck.
- **Context pressure rule** fixed — removed "3 consecutive missions" heuristic. Checks actual usage, only checkpoints at 70%.

---

## [7.6.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- **`voidforge deploy --env-only`** — write vault credentials to `.env` without provisioning infrastructure. Reads all vault keys, maps both `env:`-prefixed and hyphenated keys to env vars, appends to `.env`. Supports `VOIDFORGE_VAULT_PASSWORD` env var for non-interactive use.
- **`scripts/vault-read.ts`** — standalone vault reader. Read a single key (`--key`) or list all keys (`--list`). Supports non-interactive use via `VOIDFORGE_VAULT_PASSWORD`.
- **Campaign vault auto-inject (Step 0.5)** — if vault has credentials not yet in `.env`, auto-run `deploy --env-only` before the first mission. Blitz mode auto-runs; normal mode asks for confirmation.
- **Node.js `engines` field** in package.json — `>=20.0.0 <25.0.0`. Prevents silent ABI breaks with unsupported Node versions.

### Changed
- **Stale PTY session cleanup** — Tower auto-detects sessions that fail within 2 seconds of creation. Auto-removes the dead tab and retries once. Prevents dead sessions from consuming MAX_SESSIONS slots.
- **Fallback model ID** updated from `claude-sonnet-4-5-20241022` to `claude-sonnet-4-6`.

---

## [7.5.3] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- **Vault key naming convention** in HOLOCRON — documents hyphenated keys (global/infra) vs `env:`-prefixed keys (project-specific), with resolver order and provisioner mapping.
- **Outbound URL Safety** checklist in security audit — verify transactional emails never send localhost/private IP URLs, production fallback requirement, dedicated `EMAIL_BASE_URL` recommendation. (Field report #44)
- **Query-param state trust** attack vector in QA — Deathstroke tests whether URL parameters controlling client state are validated server-side before rendering. (Field report #44)
- **Collapsible/Accordion ARIA pattern** in component reference — `aria-expanded` + `aria-controls` + `id` triple checklist with code example. (Field report #43)
- **v7.7 The Housekeeping** planned in ROADMAP — architecture doc refresh, server auto-restart (tech debt #11), Node.js compatibility doc.
- **v7.6 bolt-ons** planned in ROADMAP — stale PTY cleanup (#12), Node.js `engines` field, fallback model ID update.
- **v8.0 ship order** in ROADMAP — Agent Memory first, then Conflict Prediction, then Auto-PRD.

### Fixed
- **Stale roadmap header** — updated from v7.1.0 to v7.5.2 with correct next version (v7.6).
- **Field reports #42-#44** triaged and closed — 4 fixes applied, 2 already-fixed, 2 deferred to v7.6, 2 wontfix.

---

## [7.5.2] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- **Credentials flow documentation** in HOLOCRON — explains how vault credentials reach `.env` during build and deploy.
- **v7.6 The Vault Pipeline** planned in ROADMAP — `deploy --env-only`, standalone vault reader, campaign auto-inject.

---

## [7.5.1] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- **Vault awareness in campaign** — Kira checks vault status in Step 0, Dax classifies credentials as "vault-available" instead of BLOCKED. (Field report #40)
- **Troi pre-scan before Victory** — verifies all PRD claims before declaring "all complete." (Field report #38)
- **Cross-file dependency check** in per-mission review — catch cross-module integration gaps. (Field report #38)
- **Deployment verification** in Assembler Phase 9 — check if project is already live before suggesting deploy steps. (Field report #37)
- **Deployment section** in build-state.md template. (Field report #37)

### Changed
- **Security audit** gains 5 new checklist items: anonymity invariant, filesystem access, constant-time comparison, sanitizer baseline, auth framework rate limiting. (Field reports #36, #38)
- **API route pattern** gains Prisma select-on-mutations rule and fire-and-forget endpoint (sendBeacon/CSRF) guidance. (Field report #36)
- **Service pattern** gains Prisma select-on-mutation example. (Field report #36)
- **Campaign** gains data model retrofit check, pattern replication check, vault-aware Dax classification. (Field reports #38, #40)
- **WCAG contrast verification** added to Galadriel's UX checklist. (Field report #38)
- **Post-pipeline deploy offer** in Assembler after Phase 13. (Field report #37)

---

## [7.5.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- **Thumper Command Center** — `/help` in Telegram shows an interactive inline keyboard grid of all 15 VoidForge commands. Tap a command → submenu shows all flag variants (e.g., `/campaign --blitz`, `/gauntlet --quick`, `/debrief --inbox`). Tap a variant to send immediately. ← Back returns to grid.
- **Bot personalization** in `/thumper setup` — auto-sets bot name (project-branded), Bilbo writes description from PRD, registers 15+1 commands in Telegram menu, generates DALL-E avatar (if OpenAI key in vault).
- **Command↔doc sync check** in `/git` Step 5.5 — flags when method docs change but paired command files don't. 13 pairs tracked.

### Fixed
- **Thumper response relay** — water-rings.sh now reads `last_assistant_message` from Stop hook stdin metadata. Previously tried to read conversation JSON from stdin (which doesn't exist), always falling back to "no summary available."
- **scan.sh non-interactive** — all `read -r -p` prompts skipped when `--token` and `--chat-id` provided. Environment confirmation and "Start now?" prompts were still blocking.

### Changed
- **`/thumper setup` is Claude-native** — conversational flow guides through BotFather, validates token via API, auto-detects chat ID, runs scan.sh non-interactive. No interactive stdin needed.
- **9 Gauntlet consistency fixes** — command files synced with method docs: Kusanagi in Round 1, Hawkeye smoke test, Lucius in Round 2 Batman, --ux-extra flag, VERSION.md/CHANGELOG.md in shared file lists, 3-mission context limit, minimum 1 review guarantee.

---

## [7.4.1] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- **Thumper scripts now synced** by `/void` — `scripts/thumper/*` added to shared files, carved out from `scripts/*` exclusion. (Field report #34)
- **Parallel agent convention lock** — schema ownership, naming conventions, required fields must be specified when launching parallel agents. (Field report #33)
- **Integration wiring check** in build protocol — verify new services are connected to consumers, TODOs resolved, workers registered. (Field report #33)
- **Cascade review checklist** — orphaned references, race conditions, PII scrubbing, reassignment fallbacks for DELETE/UPDATE operations. (Field report #31)
- **Mandatory end-of-campaign debrief** — `/debrief --submit` required after Victory Gauntlet, non-negotiable. (Field report #31)
- **Campaign state auto-sync** — cross-reference git log against campaign-state.md at session start. (Field report #32)
- **3-mission context pressure limit** — checkpoint and consider fresh session after 3 consecutive build missions. (Field report #33)

### Changed
- **Proxy route SSRF** added to security checklist — validate target paths against regex allowlist. (Field report #33)
- **No secrets in stored data** — verify no API keys/tokens embedded in database-stored URLs. (Field report #33)
- **Crypto randomness** check — flag `Math.random()` in token/code/identifier generation. (Field report #32)
- **Deeper PRD scan** in Dax's analysis — grep for feature completeness, not just file existence. (Field report #32)
- **Database fixtures** guidance — always use shared conftest, never custom DDL. (Field report #31)

---

## [7.4.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- **Runtime smoke test** in Gauntlet Round 2 — start server, hit endpoints, test WebSocket lifecycle. Catches what static analysis misses. (Field report #30)
- **First-run scenario checklist** in QA — fresh install, server restart, project import, dependency update transitions. (Field report #30)
- **Restart resilience checklist** in DevOps — inventory in-memory state, define recovery paths. (Field report #30)
- **Campaign-mode assemble pipeline** — reduced phases (arch + build + 1 review + security if needed) for multi-mission campaigns. Full pipeline deferred to Victory Gauntlet. (Field report #26)
- **Lightweight inline debrief** option for blitz — 3-line summary to log file when full `/debrief --submit` is too heavy. (Field report #26)
- **Minimum 1 review round guarantee** — even `--fast` gets 1 review, never 0. (Field report #28)

### Changed
- **Direct-ID entity access** is now High severity minimum in security audit — never defer. (Field report #28)
- **Role enforcement** must cover ALL write routes, not just CRUD — batch, merge, import/export, admin utilities. (Field report #28)
- **Admin self-referential case** added to UX checklist — disable destructive actions on own user row. (Field report #28)
- **SQL fragment builders** must accept alias parameter from day 1 — breaks in JOINs without it. (Field report #28)
- **Per-item processing** for unreliable inputs — individual items with timeouts, not batch. (Field report #27)
- **Cache AI agent outputs** — reuse cached intermediate results to prevent cross-generation drift. (Field report #27)
- **Server components for content pages** — "use client" on marketing pages kills SEO. (Field report #27)
- **Background operations need visible progress** — loading state, progress indicator, completion notification. (Field report #27)
- **Mode instructions must replace, not append** — each mode needs complete spec, not a footnote. (Field report #27)
- **Platform networking** — bind `::` (dual-stack) not `127.0.0.1`. macOS resolves localhost to IPv6. (Field report #30)
- **Tailwind v4 deployment guide** — pin versions, restrict source scanning, avoid `attr()` in CSS. (Field report #29)
- **Don't interleave debugging with syncs** — sync first, verify, THEN debug separately. (Field report #29)
- **Infrastructure dependency exception** — zero-dep policy applies to business logic, not protocol infrastructure (ws, node-pty). (Field report #30)

---

## [7.3.2] - 2026-03-16

### Changed
- **Blitz debrief is now a blocking gate** — `/debrief --submit` must complete before the campaign loop continues. Previously it was a suggestion that agents skipped in velocity mode. Now it blocks progression. (Field reports #24, #25)
- **Blitz per-mission checklist** added to campaign command header — 5 mandatory items (assemble, git, debrief, state update, proceed) that must be verified before each loop-back.
- **Blitz mode documented in CAMPAIGN.md method doc** — full section under "Two Modes" explaining what blitz changes, what it preserves, and that `--blitz ≠ --fast`. (Field report #25)
- **Debrief issue tracking** in campaign state — mission table now includes debrief issue number column.
- **Blitz privacy exception** in FIELD_MEDIC.md — user opted into autonomous mode, so auto-submit is permitted without review. (Field report #25)
- **Blitz checkpoint enforcement** — explicit mission counter instruction in Step 4.5 with mandatory logging. (Field report #23)
- **"No questions in blitz"** rule — all decisions autonomous, choose quality-preserving option when uncertain. (Field report #23)
- **Tier enforcement extended to UI components** — QA now greps `.tsx`/`.jsx` for hardcoded tier comparisons. (Field report #22)
- **Action inventory before hiding containers** — UX redesigns must list all primary AND secondary actions before collapsing/hiding a component. (Field report #22)
- **Test schema vs. production schema** check — verify test fixtures create all tables from migration runner. (Field report #21)
- **Timestamp format enforcement** — QA greps for non-canonical `strftime`/format calls. (Field report #21)
- **Auth retrofit audit** — when adding auth to a router, audit ALL existing endpoints in that file. (Field report #21)

---

## [7.3.1] - 2026-03-16

### Changed
- **`/campaign --blitz` now auto-debriefs after every mission.** In blitz mode, `/debrief --submit` runs automatically after each mission completes, filing a GitHub field report with learnings while context is fresh. No user review needed — blitz trusts the output. Run `/debrief --inbox` on the upstream repo later to triage accumulated reports. This is the missing feedback loop for autonomous builds: every mission's failures, patterns, and methodology gaps are captured even when nobody is watching.

---

## [7.3.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- **`/campaign --blitz`** — Fully autonomous campaign mode. Skips mission confirmation prompts, implies `--fast`, auto-continues between missions. Victory Gauntlet still mandatory. Use when you want to click "Start Building" and walk away.
- **Lobby build-state indicator** — Project cards show contextual buttons: "Start Building" (Phase 0), "Resume Build" (Phase 1-12), "Open Room" (built/deployed). Color-coded badge shows current state.
- **Tower vault unlock form** — When the vault is locked (server restart, import), the Tower shows an inline password form instead of a cryptic error. Unlock → auto-retries terminal creation.
- **Tower auto-send countdown** — After Claude Code launches, a 3-second countdown auto-types the command (e.g., `/campaign --blitz`). Cancel button available.

### Fixed
- **WebSocket terminal connection** — Replaced custom WebSocket implementation with the `ws` library (same as VS Code). The custom handshake was incompatible with Node.js v24's HTTP internals, causing `code 1006` connection failures in all browsers.
- **IPv6 localhost binding** — Server now binds to `::` (dual-stack) in local mode. macOS resolves `localhost` to `::1` (IPv6 first); binding to `127.0.0.1` broke WebSocket connections.
- **PTY Enter key** — Auto-send used `\n` (line feed) instead of `\r` (carriage return). PTY terminals require `\r` to simulate the Enter key.
- **Build status "Live" false positive** — Projects with a `deployUrl` set during wizard setup (intended domain) showed as "Live" even at Phase 0. Now requires both `deployUrl` AND `lastDeployAt` to confirm actual deployment.
- **Static file caching** — Added `Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate` to static file responses. Prevents browsers from serving stale JS after server updates.
- **CSP connect-src** — Added `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net` to allow xterm.js source map fetching.

### Changed
- **Claude Code in Tower** now launches with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` for autonomous operation.
- **`ws` + `@types/ws`** added as dependencies (replaces 200+ lines of custom WebSocket code).

---

## [7.2.1] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed
- **Avengers Tower terminal crash on Node.js v24** — `posix_spawnp failed` error when opening terminal. Upgraded `node-pty` from 1.1.0 to 1.2.0-beta.12 which includes prebuilds compatible with Node v24's ABI.

---

## [7.2.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- **Third-party script loading pattern** — Three-state pattern (loading/ready/error) for external script dependencies (`docs/patterns/third-party-script.ts`)
- **v8.0-v9.0+ roadmap** — The Hive Mind (Agent Memory, Conflict Prediction, `/prd`), The Evolution (Self-Improving Methodology, Agent Specialization), The Autonomy (`/campaign --autonomous`), The Horizon (Pattern Evolution, Cross-Project, Multi-Language)
- **7 enchantment animations** — Forge-lit pulse on vault unlock, streaming cursor for PRD generation, success icon pop, directional step transitions, primary button gradient glow, subtitle delayed fade-in, status message slide-in

### Changed
- **Vault password minimum raised to 8 characters** — was 4, now consistent with security best practices (server + client)
- **TOTP validation enforces exactly 6 digits** — rejects alphabetic and short/long codes per RFC 6238
- **Provisioning concurrency lock** — check-and-set is now synchronous (same event loop tick), preventing TOCTOU race on concurrent requests
- **Manifest writes serialized** — all mutation functions in provision-manifest.ts now use write queue, preventing race conditions
- **PTY cols/rows clamped before spawnOptions** — consistent with resize clamping, prevents oversized terminal dimensions
- **ANTHROPIC_API_KEY excluded from remote PTY** — operator's API key no longer leaks to deployer-role terminal sessions
- **11 methodology fixes** from 5 field reports: execution order verification (Gauntlet), Node.js mutex pattern (Backend), symlink resolution (Security), CSS animation replay (Frontend), cross-file flow tracing (Assembler), VERSION.md content checks (Forge Keeper + void), .claude/settings.json in /void "Never touch" list

### Security
- **HSTS header** in remote mode (`Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`)
- **Vault cache timing-safe comparison** — uses `timingSafeEqual` instead of `===` for password check
- **UUID validation on manifest runId** — prevents path traversal via crafted cleanup requests
- **Symlink resolution** in project import — `fs.realpath()` prevents symlink attacks pointing outside project directory

### Fixed
- **Skip navigation link** added for keyboard/screen reader users (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- **ARIA tab linkage** — PRD tabs have ids, aria-controls, and aria-labelledby
- **Section aria-labelledby** — all wizard step sections linked to their headings
- **noscript fallback** — shows clear message when JavaScript is disabled
- **--text-muted contrast** raised from #767676 to #8a8a8a (5.76:1 ratio, WCAG AA compliant)
- **Heading "Describe Your Vision"** replaces "Product Requirements" — matches PRD three-act language
- **Backward animation direction** — navigating from step 5 to 4b now plays slide-left (not slide-right)
- **Forge-lit animation replay** — vault unlock pulse replays correctly on repeated attempts via reflow trick

---

## [7.1.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- **Operations menu** — Act 3 presents expandable cards: Deploy Target, Cloud Credentials, Domain & Hostname, Resilience Pack. Pick what you need, skip the rest.
- **Resilience Pack** — 10 opt-in toggles for operational hardening: multi-env, preview deploys, auto-rollback, migrations, backups, health check, graceful shutdown, error boundaries, rate limiting, dead letter queue.
- **Live header** — Shows "Gandalf — [Project Name]" as you type.

### Changed
- **Three-act wizard flow** — "Secure Your Forge" (vault → API key) → "Describe Your Vision" (project → PRD) → "Equip Your Project" (operations menu). Vault and API key split into separate focused screens. Domain/hostname moved to operations menu.
- **Act-based progress labels** — "Act 1 — Secure Your Forge" instead of "Step 3 of 7".

### Removed
- **Simple/Advanced toggle** — Eliminated. Every user gets the same flow; configure depth via the operations menu.

---

## [7.0.1] - 2026-03-15

### Changed
- **Gandalf wizard redesigned as Three-Act Flow** — identity (vault + key), vision (name + PRD), operations (menu of cards). Eliminates simple/advanced toggle. Éowyn's enchantment notes woven into each act.
- **v4.3 reclassified as "The Resilience Pack"** — opt-in card in Gandalf's Act 3 operations menu with 10 toggles (5 deploy + 5 runtime resilience). Smart defaults based on deploy target and framework.
- **v7.1 "The Redesign" added to ROADMAP** — implementation plan for the wizard UX overhaul.

### Fixed
- **SSRF bypass checklist** added to Kenobi's security audit — octal IPs, decimal IPs, IPv6, DNS rebinding, URL scheme bypass (field report #12).
- **AI output sanitization checklist** added — nested structure handling, secure fallback paths, isolated-vm requirement, sandbox escape test (field report #11).
- **"Grep for siblings" rule** added to Batman's QA Pass 2 and Gauntlet fix batches — fix ALL instances of a pattern, not just the one reported (field reports #11 + #12).
- **Encoding variant check** added to Gauntlet fix batch protocol — verify security filters handle all name encodings (field report #12).
- **Enum consumer sweep** added to Build Protocol Phase 5 — grep all consumers when adding new enum values (field report #11).
- **Cross-surface consistency sweep** added to Build Protocol Phase 8 — search all surfaces when changing pricing/tiers/counts (field report #11).
- **Kusanagi added to Gauntlet Round 1** — infrastructure issues discovered earlier, not deferred to Round 3 (field report #11).
- **Whitelist-over-blocklist** documented as general security principle in Kenobi's method doc (field report #12).

---

## [7.0.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- **The Penthouse — Multi-User RBAC** — Three roles (admin, deployer, viewer) with invitation-only user creation. TOTP mandatory. ROUTE_ROLES middleware enforces role hierarchy on every API endpoint.
  - `wizard/lib/user-manager.ts` — User CRUD, invitation system (24h tokens, single-use, timing-safe comparison), `hasRole()` hierarchy, `hasProjectAccess()` per-project checks.
  - `wizard/api/users.ts` — User management endpoints: list, invite, complete-invite, remove, role change. All admin-gated with defense-in-depth.
- **Per-Project Access Control** — Project ownership and access lists. Each project has an owner and a list of `{ username, role }` entries. Queries filtered by access — users only see projects they own or have been granted access to.
  - `grantAccess()`, `revokeAccess()`, `getProjectsForUser()`, `checkProjectAccess()` in project-registry.
  - Access management modal in Lobby UI with focus trap, Escape handler, DOM-safe event binding.
  - Role badges on project cards (Owner/Deployer/Viewer).
- **Linked Services** — Bidirectional project linking for monorepo orchestration. BFS group resolution with cycle detection. Coordinated deploy checks across linked services.
  - `wizard/lib/deploy-coordinator.ts` — `checkDeployNeeded()`, `getDeployPlan()` with audit.
  - Link/unlink API endpoints with dual-ownership verification.
  - Link management modal in Lobby UI.
- **Rollback Dashboard** — Deploy history panel in Avengers Tower with collapsible sidebar, keyboard navigation (Escape to close), `aria-expanded`/`aria-controls`.
  - `wizard/ui/rollback.js` — viewer-gated deploy history display.
- **Cost Tracker** — Aggregate monthly costs across all accessible projects via existing `monthlyCost` field. NaN/negative guard on writes.
  - `wizard/lib/cost-tracker.ts` — `getAggregateCosts()`, `setProjectCost()`.
  - Lobby Penthouse footer fetches real cost data from API.
- **Agent Memory** — Cross-project lesson storage for methodology learning. 1000-entry cap with oldest-eviction. Serialized writes, atomic file ops.
  - `wizard/lib/agent-memory.ts` — `addLesson()`, `getLessons()`, `getRelevantLessons()`.
  - `~/.voidforge/lessons.json` (0600 permissions).
- 4 Architecture Decision Records: ADR-028 (RBAC), ADR-029 (per-project access), ADR-030 (linked services), ADR-031 (observatory features).

### Changed
- `tower-auth.ts` — Extended for multi-user: `UserRole` type, `SessionInfo` return from `validateSession()`, role in sessions, `createUser()` accepts role, `removeUser()`/`updateUserRole()`/`listUsers()`/`getUserRole()` added, legacy user migration (pre-v7.0 users get `role: 'admin'`), username character validation (`/^[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+$/`), X-Forwarded-For takes rightmost IP.
- `server.ts` — ROUTE_ROLES middleware maps API paths to minimum roles. WebSocket upgrade uses `hasRole()` (not hardcoded string). CSRF error format standardized. User context propagated to handlers.
- `project-registry.ts` — `owner`, `access`, `linkedProjects` fields. `removeProject()` cleans up linked references. `removeUserFromAllProjects()` clears ownership on user deletion. BFS `getLinkedGroup()`.
- `pty-manager.ts` — `username` field in PtySession for audit trail.
- `terminal.ts` — Per-project access checks, user context extraction, session list filtered by ownership, kill endpoint with ownership check.
- `lobby.js` — Role-aware UI: conditional buttons per role, access/link modals with focus traps, cost display from API.
- `lobby.html` — Access modal, link modal, role badge styling, linked badge styling.
- `tower.html` — Rollback panel with a11y attributes.

### Fixed
- Tailwind v4 content scanning check added to Galadriel's UX method (field report #10).
- Platform Build Gate added to Kusanagi's DevOps method (field report #10).

### Security
- ROUTE_ROLES enforces minimum role on all 45+ API endpoints (defense-in-depth with handler-level checks).
- Per-project access returns 404 (not 403) to prevent information leakage.
- Invite tokens: 256-bit, timing-safe comparison, 24h expiry, single-use with rollback on failure.
- Terminal sessions filtered by user — deployers can only see/kill their own sessions.
- Viewer blocked from terminals (WebSocket + REST), deploy metadata, and write operations.
- User removal clears project ownership to prevent privilege escalation via username reuse.
- Session cookie always sets Secure flag in remote mode (not header-dependent).
- `ProjectAccessEntry.role` tightened to `'deployer' | 'viewer'` (admin grants blocked at API).
- 52 security/quality findings resolved across 4 missions + 2 Gauntlet checkpoints.

---

## [6.5.1] - 2026-03-15

### Changed
- **The Arthurian Retcon** — All Arthurian legend references removed from the codebase. VoidForge's identity is rooted in its declared fictional universes (Tolkien, Marvel, DC, Star Wars, Star Trek, Dune, Anime). Arthurian legend was never one of them.
  - **Merlin → Gandalf** (Tolkien) — Setup wizard is now Gandalf. *"I'm looking for someone to share in an adventure."* The wizard who kicks off the journey.
  - **Gandalf → Radagast** (Tolkien) — UX edge-cases sub-agent renamed to free the name. Radagast notices things at the boundaries others overlook.
  - **Camelot → Avengers Tower** (Marvel) — Browser terminal / operations console. Stark's HQ. Every project gets a floor.
  - **Great Hall → The Lobby** (Marvel) — Multi-project dashboard. Where you see every floor at a glance.
  - **Round Table → The Penthouse** (Marvel) — v7.0 multi-user coordination. Where the team meets. Top floor.
- 39 files modified, 5 files renamed, ~180 replacements across code + docs.

---

## [6.5.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- **Avengers Tower Remote** — self-hosted VoidForge with 5-layer security. Access your forge from any browser, anywhere.
  - `wizard/lib/tower-auth.ts` — Full authentication engine: PBKDF2 password hashing (210k iterations, NIST SP 800-63B), TOTP 2FA (RFC 6238 with replay protection), session management (in-memory only, 8-hour TTL, IP binding, single active session), rate limiting (5/min, 10-consecutive lockout for 30 min), serialized writes, periodic cleanup.
  - `wizard/api/auth.ts` — Login, logout, session check, initial setup endpoints. Runtime type validation, field length caps, Cache-Control: no-store on auth responses.
  - `wizard/ui/login.html` + `wizard/ui/login.js` — Login page with setup flow (first-time TOTP enrollment) and auth flow (username + password + TOTP). Keyboard accessible, autofill-friendly.
  - `wizard/lib/audit-log.ts` — Append-only JSON lines audit trail at `~/.voidforge/audit.log`. Logs: login attempts, sessions, vault events, terminal sessions, deploys, credential access. 10MB rotation. Never crashes the server.
  - `wizard/lib/provisioners/self-deploy.ts` — VoidForge self-deploy provisioner: installs Node.js, Caddy, PM2, creates forge-user, generates Caddy HTTPS config, starts VoidForge as a managed service.
  - ADR-027: Avengers Tower Remote 5-Layer Security Architecture.

### Changed
- `wizard/server.ts` — Auth middleware gates all routes in remote mode (exempt: login/setup/static). WebSocket upgrade validates Avengers Tower session. CSP includes `wss://` for remote WebSocket. CORS expanded for remote domain. Binds to `0.0.0.0` in remote mode.
- `wizard/lib/pty-manager.ts` — Remote mode: 20 max sessions (vs. 5 local), audit log integration (terminal_start/terminal_end), forge-user sandboxing.
- `wizard/ui/lobby.html` + `wizard/ui/lobby.js` — Auth-aware: shows username, logout button, redirects to login when unauthenticated.
- `scripts/voidforge.ts` — `--remote` flag (remote mode), `--self` flag (self-deploy), `--host` flag (domain name).

### Security
- Two-password architecture: login password (bcrypt/PBKDF2) ≠ vault password (AES-256-GCM). Compromised session cannot read credentials.
- TOTP replay protection: lastTotpStep tracked per user, codes rejected at or before last used step.
- Rate limiting with memory cleanup: periodic eviction of expired sessions and stale rate-limit entries.
- Setup endpoint rate-limited and serialized to prevent race-to-setup attacks.
- X-Forwarded-For only trusted in remote mode (behind Caddy reverse proxy).
- Auth store throws on corruption (prevents silent re-setup attack vector).
- Shell injection prevention in self-deploy: input validation + shell escaping.
- IP binding on sessions: mismatch invalidates session entirely.

---

## [6.0.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- **Avengers Tower Multi — The Lobby** — multi-project operations console. Dashboard shows all VoidForge projects with health status, deploy URL, framework badge, cost, and quick actions.
  - `wizard/lib/project-registry.ts` — CRUD for `~/.voidforge/projects.json`. Serialized writes (vault pattern), atomic file ops (temp + fsync + rename), backup before overwrite, field validation on read, MUTABLE_FIELDS allowlist on update.
  - `wizard/api/projects.ts` — REST API: list all, get by ID, import existing project, delete from registry. Runtime type validation on all inputs, path canonicalization via `resolve()`.
  - `wizard/ui/lobby.html` + `wizard/ui/lobby.js` — The Lobby dashboard with project cards, health indicators (color + text labels for WCAG 1.4.1), import modal with focus trap, keyboard-navigable cards, 30-second polling.
  - `wizard/lib/health-poller.ts` — Background health checks every 5 minutes. Parallel via `Promise.allSettled`, 5-second timeout per project, SSRF protection (private IP blocklist, redirect blocking, hex/octal/IPv6 coverage).
- **Import Existing Project** — `POST /api/projects/import` scans a directory for CLAUDE.md, PRD frontmatter, .env, build-state, and auto-detects framework from package.json/requirements.txt/Gemfile.
- **Back-to-Lobby navigation** in Avengers Tower — "← Lobby" button with session persistence confirmation.
- ADR-026: Project Registry and The Lobby Architecture.

### Changed
- Server landing page changed from Gandalf (`/index.html`) to The Lobby (`/lobby.html`). Gandalf still accessible via direct URL and "New Project" buttons.
- `wizard/server.ts` — health poller lifecycle (start on listen, stop before PTY cleanup), double-shutdown guard, CORS fix (non-matching origins get no allow-origin header).
- `wizard/api/project.ts` — registers new projects in registry, runtime type validation on all body fields, .env template injection prevention (newline stripping).
- `wizard/ui/tower.html` — ARIA landmarks (`<main>`, `role="alert"`), `:focus-visible` on buttons, `prefers-reduced-motion` support.

### Security
- SSRF prevention in health poller: URL scheme validation, private IP blocklist (IPv4, IPv6, hex, octal, decimal, 0.0.0.0, metadata endpoints), `redirect: 'manual'` to prevent redirect-based SSRF.
- CORS hardened: non-matching origins no longer receive `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header.
- .env injection prevention: newlines stripped from all template-interpolated fields (name, description, domain, hostname, deploy target).
- Runtime type validation on `/api/project/create` body fields (was unsafe `as` cast).
- Registry file backup before every write (data loss prevention).

### Fixed
- **Field Report #9:** Rex (Kenobi's security team) now checks build output HTML for inline scripts before tightening CSP. Gauntlet adds build-output verification gate after every fix batch. Prevents framework-generated inline scripts (Next.js, Nuxt, SvelteKit) from being blocked by CSP changes.

---

## [5.5.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- **Avengers Tower Local** — browser terminal with real Claude Code. Never leave the browser.
  - `wizard/lib/pty-manager.ts` — PTY lifecycle management using `node-pty`. Spawns real shell processes, manages multiple sessions per project, 30-min idle timeout, max 5 concurrent sessions.
  - `wizard/api/terminal.ts` — WebSocket ↔ PTY bridge (raw RFC 6455 implementation). REST endpoints for session CRUD. Vault password required to establish connections.
  - `wizard/ui/tower.html` + `wizard/ui/tower.js` — browser terminal UI using xterm.js. Tabbed interface: multiple terminals per project (Claude Code, Shell, SSH). Auto-launches Claude Code on open. Resize handling, session reconnection on navigate-back.
  - "Open in Avengers Tower" button on Gandalf's done screen — transitions directly from project creation to browser terminal.
  - WebSocket upgrade handler in `wizard/server.ts` — routes `/ws/terminal` to PTY bridge.
  - Graceful shutdown: `killAllSessions()` on SIGINT/SIGTERM.
- New dependency: `node-pty` (~2MB native module, same as VS Code terminal)
- CSP updated to allow xterm.js CDN and WebSocket connections

---

## [5.0.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- **Lessons integration** — Wong extracts learnings after every `/assemble` run and appends to `LESSONS.md`. Lessons confirmed across 2+ projects are flagged for promotion to method docs. `/build` Phase 0 now loads relevant lessons from prior projects to inform the current build.
- **Build analytics** — `wizard/lib/build-analytics.ts` tracks metrics across projects: phase findings, fix-to-finding ratios, framework-specific trends. Stored at `~/.voidforge/analytics.json`. `surfaceTrends()` generates human-readable insights.
- **Smart scoping** — `/campaign` now orders missions complexity-first within dependency tiers. Hardest features (most integrations, edge cases, schema relationships) built first when energy is fresh; polish and admin later.
- **Project templates** — 4 curated starters: SaaS (Next.js + Stripe + teams), REST API (Express + Postgres), Marketing Site (Next.js + Tailwind), Admin Dashboard (Next.js + shadcn/ui). `npx voidforge init --template saas` or select in Gandalf wizard. `npx voidforge templates` lists all available.
  - New file: `wizard/lib/templates.ts` — template definitions with frontmatter, suggested integrations, and PRD scaffolding
  - New API: `GET /api/prd/templates`, `GET /api/prd/templates/get?id=saas`
  - New CLI: `npx voidforge templates` command

---

## [4.6.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- **`/debrief --inbox`** — Bashir's inbox mode: fetches open `field-report` issues from GitHub, triages each one (accept/already-fixed/wontfix/needs-info), applies accepted fixes, comments on issues with triage results, closes resolved issues. Completes the feedback loop: downstream submits → upstream triages → `/void` propagates fixes.
- **`/imagine` retry logic** — 3 attempts with exponential backoff (1s, 3s, 9s) for DALL-E server errors (500/502/503). ~15% of requests hit transient failures; now handled automatically.
- **Global CSS conflict check** in `/ux` Step 1.5 — Galadriel checks for specificity conflicts between global stylesheets and component-level utilities (Tailwind, CSS modules). Common traps: `overflow: hidden` on parents, stacking context conflicts, `:focus-visible` bleed-through.

### Changed
- Count cross-referencing in `/qa` already existed (shipped in v4.4.0) — confirmed during field report triage, no changes needed.

---

## [4.5.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- **PRD-driven credential collection** — Gandalf Step 4.5: after pasting a PRD, the wizard parses the env var section and presents a dynamic form to collect project-specific API keys (WhatsApp, Mapbox, Google Places, etc.). All stored in the vault with AES-256-GCM encryption.
  - New API endpoint: `POST /api/prd/env-requirements` — parses PRD content for service-specific credentials
  - New API endpoint: `POST /api/credentials/env-batch` — stores multiple credentials in one call
  - New Gandalf step between PRD and Deploy Target with accordion-style credential groups
- **Headless deploy mode** — `npx voidforge deploy --headless` runs the full provisioner pipeline from the terminal without opening a browser. Uses vault credentials and PRD frontmatter. Progress output to stdout with colored status icons. Used by `/build` Phase 12 so you never leave Claude Code.
  - New file: `wizard/lib/headless-deploy.ts` — terminal adapter for provisioner pipeline
  - Updated `scripts/voidforge.ts` with `--headless` and `--dir` flags
  - Updated `/build` Phase 12 to reference headless deploy
- **PostgreSQL extension support** — VPS provisioner now detects `postgis` and `pg_trgm` from Prisma schema's `extensions` directive and generates install commands in `provision.sh`
  - Updated `wizard/lib/provisioners/scripts/provision-vps.ts` with extension block generator
  - Updated `wizard/api/deploy.ts` to parse Prisma schema for extensions

### Changed
- Gandalf navigation updated to handle Step 4b (project credentials) with proper back/forward flow
- HOLOCRON updated with headless deploy documentation
- `/build` Phase 12 now references `npx voidforge deploy --headless` as the primary deploy path

---

## [4.4.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- **`/imagine` command** — Celebrimbor's Forge: AI image generation from PRD visual descriptions. Scans PRD for illustrations, portraits, OG images, hero art. Derives style from brand section. Generates via OpenAI API with asset manifest for regeneration. Provider-abstracted.
  - New agent: **Celebrimbor** (Tolkien, Silmarillion) — "Hand of Silver," greatest elven smith
  - Sub-agents: **Nori** (asset scanner), **Ori** (prompt engineer), **Dori** (integration checker)
- **`/debrief` command** — Bashir's Field Reports: post-session analysis that identifies methodology gaps and proposes fixes in VoidForge's own language. Can submit structured post-mortems as GitHub issues on the upstream repo.
  - New agent: **Bashir** (Star Trek DS9) — chief medical officer, diagnostician
  - Sub-agents: **Ezri** (timeline), **O'Brien** (root cause), **Nog** (solutions), **Jake** (report)
- `wizard/lib/image-gen.ts` — Image generation provider abstraction with OpenAI support, asset manifest, cost estimation
- `wizard/lib/asset-scanner.ts` — PRD parser for visual asset requirements with brand style extraction
- `docs/methods/FORGE_ARTIST.md` — Celebrimbor's full method doc
- `docs/methods/FIELD_MEDIC.md` — Bashir's full method doc

### Changed
- Lead agent count: 11 → 13 (Celebrimbor + Bashir)
- Command count: 13 → 15 (`/imagine` + `/debrief`)
- NAMING_REGISTRY.md: 7 new character entries (Celebrimbor, Nori, Ori, Dori, Ezri, Nog, Jake)

---

## [4.2.0] - 2026-03-14

### Added
- **Prisma type generation** (ADR-025) — runs `prisma generate` and creates `types/index.ts` barrel export. Conditional on Prisma schema existing.
- **OpenAPI spec generation** (ADR-025) — generates starter `docs/api.yaml` with framework-aware defaults. Users fill in their endpoints.
- **Database ERD generation** (ADR-025) — parses Prisma schema and generates `docs/schema.md` with Mermaid entity-relationship diagram.
- **Database seeding** (ADR-025) — generates `prisma/seed.ts` with factory functions for all models. Run with `npx tsx prisma/seed.ts`.
- **Integration templates** (ADR-025) — pre-built client wrappers selected via PRD frontmatter:
  - `payments: stripe` → `lib/stripe.ts` (checkout, portal, webhooks)
  - `email: resend` → `lib/resend.ts` (transactional email)
  - `storage: s3` → `lib/s3-upload.ts` (signed URL upload/download)

### Security
- All integration templates validate required env vars at startup (fail-fast, not silent fallback)

---

## [4.1.0] - 2026-03-14

### Added
- **Structured deploy logs** (ADR-021) — every successful provision is persisted to `~/.voidforge/deploys/` with timestamp, target, URL, resources, and sanitized outputs. New `/api/deploys` endpoint to query deploy history.
- **AWS cost estimation** (ADR-022) — before provisioning AWS targets (VPS/S3), emits an estimated monthly cost based on instance type, RDS, and ElastiCache selections. Informational only, does not block.
- **Post-deploy health monitoring** (ADR-023) — VPS: generates `infra/healthcheck.sh` cron script (curl every 5 minutes, log failures). Platforms: emits direct links to Vercel Analytics, Railway Metrics, or Cloudflare dashboard.
- **Sentry error tracking** (ADR-024) — optional integration. When `sentry-dsn` exists in vault, generates framework-specific Sentry SDK initialization code (`sentry.ts`, `sentry.client.config.ts`, or `sentry_config.py`). Writes DSN to `.env`. Non-fatal — works without it.

### Security
- Deploy log outputs are sanitized (password/secret/token keys stripped) before persisting to disk — same logic as SSE output sanitizer.
- Health check script sanitizes projectName and deployUrl to prevent shell injection in generated bash.

---

## [4.0.0] - 2026-03-14

### Added
- **Pre-deploy build step** (ADR-016) — framework-aware build runs BEFORE any deploy action. Detects build command and output directory per framework (Node, Django, Rails). Installs dependencies automatically. Skips if output already exists or no package.json found.
- **GitHub Actions CI/CD generation** (ADR-017) — generates `ci.yml` (test + lint on PR) and `deploy.yml` (deploy on merge to main) during GitHub pre-step. Framework-aware test/lint/build commands. Deploy target-specific workflows (Vercel, Cloudflare, Railway, VPS, S3). Required secrets documented in generated files.
- **Environment validation script** (ADR-018) — generates `validate-env.js` or `validate_env.py` that checks all required env vars at startup. Detects placeholder values. Works in both CommonJS and ESM projects.
- **Credential scoping** (ADR-020) — each provisioner only receives the vault keys it needs, not the full vault. Extends the cleanup scoping pattern from v3.8.0 to the provisioning phase. Internal `_`-prefixed keys (GitHub metadata) pass through.

### Changed
- **Railway API migration** (ADR-019) — replaced deprecated `pluginCreate` GraphQL mutation with `templateDeploy` for database/Redis provisioning. Falls back to `serviceCreate` if templates unavailable. Fixed custom domain ordering (now created after service). Deploy polling queries by service ID to target the correct service.
- `provision.ts` — framework value normalized to lowercase at boundary. Build failure message clarified. Fatal error now includes sanitized detail. Hostname validation includes format example. keepaliveTimer moved into finally block.
- `github.ts` — accepts framework/deployTarget params for CI/CD generation. Second commit/push for workflow files after initial push.
- S3 deploy uses framework-aware output directory via `getBuildOutputDir()` instead of hardcoded `dist`.

### Architecture
- 5 new ADRs: 016 (build step), 017 (CI/CD), 018 (env validation), 019 (Railway templates), 020 (credential scoping)

---

## [3.9.1] - 2026-03-14

### Added
- **ROADMAP.md** — 5-version strategic roadmap (v4.0 Reliability → v5.0 Intelligence)
- **PRD-VOIDFORGE.md** — VoidForge's own product requirements document (root-level, not synced to user projects via /void)
- **`/campaign --plan`** — planning mode: update PRD and ROADMAP with new ideas without building. Dax analyzes where it fits, Odo checks dependencies, presents changes for review.

### Changed
- `/campaign` PRD discovery: checks `/PRD-VOIDFORGE.md` at root first, falls back to `/docs/PRD.md`. User projects unaffected.

---

## [3.9.0] - 2026-03-14

### Added
- **/campaign command** — Sisko's Danger Room: read the PRD, pick the next mission, finish the fight, repeat until done. Autonomous campaign execution with mission scoping, dependency ordering, and The Prophecy Board for tracking progress across sessions.
- **Sisko** (Benjamin Sisko, DS9) promoted to 11th lead agent. Star Trek now has two leads: Picard (architecture) and Sisko (campaign). Sub-agents: Kira (ops), Dax (strategy), Odo (prerequisites).
- `docs/methods/CAMPAIGN.md` — full operating rules, 6-step sequence, session management, victory condition.
- Flags: `--resume` (continue mid-campaign), `--fast` (skip Crossfire+Council in each mission), `--mission "Name"` (jump to specific PRD section).

### Changed
- Command count updated to 13, lead count to 11 across CLAUDE.md, HOLOCRON.md, README.md, and NAMING_REGISTRY.md.

---

## [3.8.0] - 2026-03-14

### Added
- **Haku's Last Mile** — every deploy target is now fully automated end-to-end. Run `npm run deploy` and get a live URL, not a manual checklist.
- **GitHub integration** — new cloud provider in Gandalf. Collects PAT, creates repos, pushes code. Used by Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, and Railway for auto-deploy on push.
- **SSH deploy module** — provisions EC2 servers remotely (provision.sh), deploys via release-directory strategy with atomic symlink swap, health checks, and automatic rollback on failure.
- **S3 deploy via SDK** — uploads build directory to S3 with correct MIME types and cache-control headers. No AWS CLI dependency (ADR-014).
- **Shared exec utility** — child process wrapper with timeout, abort signal, and streaming (ADR-013). Used by GitHub and SSH modules.
- **Shared env-writer** — extracted .env append logic from 5 copy-pasted provisioner implementations.
- **Deploy polling** — Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, and Railway provisioners poll deployment status after git push, reporting progress until the app is live.
- **DEPLOY_URL** and **GITHUB_REPO_URL** displayed as clickable links on the Haku Done screen.
- 5 Architecture Decision Records: ADR-011 (GitHub pre-step), ADR-012 (no GitHub cleanup), ADR-013 (exec utility), ADR-014 (S3 via SDK), ADR-015 (platform auto-deploy).

### Changed
- **Vercel provisioner** — links GitHub repo, sets env vars via API, polls deploy. Re-runs (409) now fetch the existing project ID so all steps execute.
- **Cloudflare provisioner** — includes GitHub source at project creation (required by Cloudflare API). Re-runs set CF_PROJECT_URL. Next.js destination dir corrected to `out`.
- **Railway provisioner** — creates service with GitHub source, sets env vars using Railway's `${{Plugin.VAR}}` syntax. Deprecated `pluginCreate` gets clear fallback guidance.
- **AWS VPS provisioner** — uses shared slugify and env-writer. Error messages now include resource IDs and console URLs instead of generic "Check AWS Console."
- **GitHub org repos** — uses `/orgs/{owner}/repos` endpoint when owner is explicitly set, with fallback to `/user/repos`.

### Security
- **Token never touches disk** — git push uses `http.extraheader` via environment variables instead of embedding PAT in the URL. No reflog persistence (ADR-011).
- **Triple token sanitization** — error messages scrubbed with 3 regexes covering URL-embedded tokens, Base64 Authorization headers, and GIT_CONFIG env vars.
- **projectDir validation** — rejects paths with `..` segments or non-absolute paths to prevent directory traversal.
- **Credential scoping** — in-memory cleanup credentials store only target-specific keys, not the full vault.
- **Auth gate on /incomplete** — orphaned run enumeration now requires vault unlock.
- **.gitignore defense-in-depth** — verifies `.env` and `.ssh/` are protected before `git add -A`.
- **Secret stripping loop** — SSE output deletes any key containing "password", "secret", or "token" (case-insensitive).

### Fixed
- Vercel 409 (project exists) now fetches project ID — re-runs no longer silently skip linking, env vars, and deploy.
- Cloudflare 409 now sets `CF_PROJECT_URL` — re-runs show the deploy URL on the Done screen.
- Removed duplicate `slugify` from aws-vps.ts (diverged from shared implementation).
- Removed unused `httpsPut` import from vercel.ts.
- `.env` value parser strips surrounding quotes before uploading to Vercel.
- `npm ci --omit=dev` replaces `--ignore-scripts` in SSH deploy (fixes native deps like bcrypt, sharp).
- Null safety on all `safeJsonParse` casts in Cloudflare provisioner (8/8 now include `| null`).

---

## [3.7.0] - 2026-03-14

### Added
- **/assemble command** — Fury's Initiative: 13-phase full pipeline (architect → build → 3x review → UX → 2x security → devops → QA → test → crossfire → council). Calls every agent from every universe. Convergence loop, session checkpointing, --resume/--fast/--skip-build flags.
- **Fury** promoted to 10th lead agent (Marvel → The Initiative). Hill added to Marvel pool.
- **/thumper command** — Chani's Worm Rider: drive Claude Code via Telegram from anywhere. Gom Jabbar passphrase authentication with PBKDF2 hashing, message deletion, 60-minute idle timeout, 3-attempt lockout. Five bash scripts, zero dependencies.
- **Dune universe** — Chani as lead (Worm Rider) with 20 named characters. Sub-agents: Stilgar (security), Thufir Hawat (parsing), Duncan Idaho (relay), Reverend Mother Mohiam (authentication).
- **Transport auto-detection** — TMUX_SENDKEYS (cross-platform), PTY_INJECT (headless Linux), OSASCRIPT (macOS Terminal.app/iTerm2). Explicit guidance for VS Code, Warp, Alacritty, Kitty users. Windows Git Bash gets "use WSL" message.
- **Water Rings stop hook** — automatic task completion notifications to Telegram.
- **LESSONS.md** — first entries from Kongo.io Sprint 4 post-mortem.

### Changed
- **/review** — mandatory integration tracing (follow URLs/keys to consumers) and error path verification (verify UI displays specific server errors).
- **/ux** — mandatory error state testing with intentionally invalid/conflicting input.
- **/qa** — Step 2.5 smoke tests: hit the running server after build, verify cross-module paths at runtime.
- **/test** — Step 3.5 cross-module integration tests: at least one test per feature crossing module boundaries.
- **/security** — Maul executes actual HTTP exploitation attempts. Ahsoka traces the full auth middleware chain.
- **/build** — Phase 4/5/6 gates define "works manually" explicitly: error paths, cross-module integration, generated URLs.
- **/devops** — post-deploy smoke tests verify application behavior (not just infrastructure health).
- CLAUDE.md, HOLOCRON.md, README.md — 12 commands, 10 agents, 7 universes, 170+ characters.

### Security
- Gom Jabbar: PBKDF2 hashing (100k iterations), Telegram message deletion with fail-secure invalidation, idle timeout, lockout.
- Control character sanitization strips terminal-dangerous bytes from all injected messages.
- Root guard prevents /thumper from running as root.
- Empty hash bypass prevention refuses auth when hashing tools unavailable.
- Config injection prevention via `printf '%q'` and umask 077.

### Fixed
- THUMPER.md rewritten — 10+ factual errors corrected (wrong timeouts, hash algo, flow description, nonexistent CLI flags).
- Script copy clarified — hostile lockout softened, ambiguous passphrase prompts made explicit, empty notifications made useful.

---

## [3.5.3] - 2026-03-14

### Changed
- **Renamed `/voice` to `/thumper`** — resolved conflict with Claude Code's built-in `/voice` skill. A thumper is the Fremen device that summons the sandworm — plant it, the worm comes, you ride it.
- **Renamed "Remote Bridge" to "Worm Rider"** — proper Dune universe domain name for Chani's role. Worm riding is the quintessential Fremen skill.
- All files renamed: `scripts/voice/` → `scripts/thumper/`, `voice.sh` → `thumper.sh`, `VOICE.md` → `THUMPER.md`, `.voidforge/voice/` → `.voidforge/thumper/`.
- `/security` — Maul now executes actual HTTP exploitation attempts, not just conceptual red-teaming. Ahsoka traces the full auth middleware chain.
- `/build` — Phase 4/5/6 gates now define "works manually" explicitly: must test error paths and cross-module integration at runtime.
- `/devops` — Post-deploy smoke tests verify application behavior, not just infrastructure health.
- Kongo.io lessons applied across `/review`, `/ux`, `/qa`, `/test` — integration tracing, error path verification, smoke tests, cross-module tests.

---

## [3.5.0] - 2026-03-14

### Added
- **/voice command** — Chani's remote bridge: drive Claude Code sessions via Telegram from anywhere. Environment-aware setup auto-detects tmux, headless Linux, and macOS terminals.
- **Gom Jabbar authentication** — passphrase-based session gate with PBKDF2 hashing, Telegram message deletion, 60-minute idle timeout, and 3-attempt lockout. Passphrase is erased from chat history; session invalidated if deletion fails.
- **Dune universe** — 9th agent lead (Chani) with 20 named characters from Arrakis. Sub-agents: Stilgar (security), Thufir (parsing), Idaho (relay), Mohiam (authentication).
- **Water Rings stop hook** — automatic task completion notifications to Telegram when Claude Code finishes responding.
- **Transport vectors** — three injection methods: TMUX_SENDKEYS (cross-platform), PTY_INJECT (headless Linux), OSASCRIPT (macOS Terminal.app/iTerm2). Auto-detection with manual override.

### Security
- Control character sanitization strips terminal-dangerous bytes (Ctrl+C, ESC, ANSI sequences) from all incoming messages before injection.
- Root guard prevents /voice from running as root (unspoofable `id -u` check).
- Config injection prevention via `printf '%q'` escaping and umask 077 subshells.
- Empty hash bypass prevention — refuses authentication when hashing tools are unavailable.
- Credentials stored in chmod 600 sietch vault, directory chmod 700, gitignored via `.voidforge/`.

### Changed
- CLAUDE.md updated with /voice command, Chani in Team table, VOICE.md in Docs Reference.
- HOLOCRON.md updated to 11 commands, 9 agents, 7 universes, 170+ characters. Full /voice Arsenal entry with Gom Jabbar explanation.
- README.md updated with /voice in commands table, Chani in agent leads, voice/ in structure tree.
- NAMING_REGISTRY.md expanded with full Dune universe section (Chani lead + 20 pool characters).
- Environment detection improved: VS Code, Warp, Alacritty, Kitty on macOS now get explicit guidance instead of silent OSASCRIPT failure. Windows Git Bash/MSYS2 gets explicit "use WSL" message.

---

## [3.4.0] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- **/test command** — Batman's test-writing mode: coverage gap analysis, test architecture review, write missing unit/integration/component tests. Different from /qa (which finds bugs).
- **/review command** — Picard's code review: pattern compliance (Spock), code quality (Seven), maintainability (Data). Parallel analysis with re-verification pass.
- **Deathstroke** (DC) — adversarial tester added to Batman's QA team. Penetration-style probing, bypasses validations, chains unexpected interactions.
- **Constantine** (DC) — cursed code hunter added to Batman's QA team. Finds dead branches, impossible conditions, logic that only works by accident.
- **Maul** (Star Wars) — red-team attacker added to Kenobi's Security team. Thinks like an attacker, chains vulnerabilities, re-probes after remediation.
- **Double-pass review pattern** — all review phases (QA, UX, Security) now use find → fix → re-verify. Catches fix-induced regressions before they ship.

### Changed
- **Context thresholds for 1M** — checkpoint trigger raised from 15 files/30 tool calls to 50 files/100 tool calls. Pre-load active domain's methodology at session start instead of on-demand only.
- **Picard's architecture review parallelized** — Spock + Uhura run in parallel (independent), then La Forge + Data run in parallel. ~30% faster wall-clock time.
- **Stark's backend audit parallelized** — Rogers + Banner analysis in parallel, then Barton + Romanoff + Thor in parallel. Fury validates all findings.
- **Security audit restructured** — aligned method doc and command to 4 clear phases: parallel scans → sequential audits → remediate → Maul re-verifies.
- **Build protocol phases 9-11** — merged into a unified double-pass review cycle. All three agents (Batman, Galadriel, Kenobi) find issues in parallel, fixes are batched, then all three re-verify.
- **Galadriel's UX pass** — added Samwise + Gandalf re-verification after fixes to catch a11y regressions.
- **Session boundaries expanded** — small-to-medium projects can complete phases 0-8 in a single session with 1M context.
- **SUB_AGENTS.md** — added Coulson and Bombadil to the full roster table, fixed phantom anime character references.

---

## [3.3.1] - 2026-03-13

### Fixed
- **PRD generation silently truncating** — output was hard-coded to 8192 max tokens, causing complex PRDs to cut off mid-stream with no warning. Now uses each model's full output capacity (Opus 32K, Sonnet 16K, Haiku 8K).
- **No truncation feedback** — server now tracks `stop_reason` from the Claude API `message_delta` event and forwards a `truncated` signal to the client, which displays a visible warning instead of silently accepting incomplete output.

---

## [3.3.0] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- **Async resource polling** — Haku now waits for RDS (up to 15min) and ElastiCache (up to 5min) to become available, extracts real endpoints (`DB_HOST`, `REDIS_HOST`), and writes them to `.env`. No more "check the AWS Console." (ADR-009)
- **Domain registration via Cloudflare Registrar** — buy a domain through Haku as a pre-DNS step. Registration creates the zone, then DNS records are created in it. Includes availability check, price display, and non-refundable purchase confirmation gate. (ADR-010)
- **Cloudflare Account ID** field in Cloud Providers — required for domain registration, validated as 32-char hex on save
- **Post-failure registration verification** — if the registration API times out, Haku re-checks availability to detect masked successes before reporting failure

### Changed
- **Partial success UI** — if infrastructure provisions but domain/DNS fails, Haku shows "partial success" with guidance instead of binary pass/fail
- **Output display** — infra details on the Done page are now grouped logically (server → DB → cache → platform → domain → DNS) with human-readable date formatting for domain expiry
- **AbortController integration** — polling loops cancel cleanly when the client disconnects instead of running for up to 15 minutes server-side
- **HTTP client** — single retry on transient errors (ECONNRESET, ETIMEDOUT) with 2s delay; per-call timeout override (60s for registration)
- **Polling jitter** — random interval variation prevents API throttling under concurrent use
- **ADR-009** corrected to reflect actual AbortController implementation
- **Cloudflare DNS** accepts `pending` zones from fresh domain registrations (previously required `active`)

### Fixed
- **Terminal failure detection** — RDS/ElastiCache polling breaks immediately on `failed`/`deleted`/`create-failed` states instead of waiting for timeout
- **Cleanup handling** — resources in "creating" state get a manual-cleanup warning instead of a silent deletion failure
- **Asymmetric token check** — all combinations of missing Cloudflare credentials now emit clear skip messages
- **404 availability fallback** — notes that availability is unconfirmed when domain is simply absent from the account
- **Registration row** hidden for Docker (local) deploys and invalid hostnames
- **`state.deployCmd`** declared in initial state object

### Security
- **CSRF protection** — `X-VoidForge-Request` custom header required on all POST requests; triggers CORS preflight to block cross-origin form submissions
- **DB_PASSWORD stripped from SSE** — password stays in `.env` only, never sent to the browser
- **AWS error sanitization** — ARNs, account IDs, and internal identifiers no longer leak to the client
- **`.env` file permissions** — `chmod 600` applied after generation, matching SSH key protection
- **Provisioning concurrency lock** — returns 429 if a run is already in progress
- **`encodeURIComponent(accountId)`** on all Cloudflare API URL interpolations — prevents path injection
- **Domain + Account ID validation** at client, server, and registrar layers
- **Random password suffix** replaces static `A1!` — uppercase + digit + special char now randomized
- **Hostname allowlist** documented in HTTP client module

## [3.2.0] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- **`/void` slash command** — Bombadil's Forge Sync. Self-update mechanism that fetches the latest VoidForge methodology from the scaffold branch, compares every shared file, shows a human-readable update plan, and applies changes while preserving project-specific customizations (PRD, logs, code, CLAUDE.md project section). Works on all three tiers.
- **Forge Keeper method doc** (`docs/methods/FORGE_KEEPER.md`) — Bombadil's protocol with 5-step update sequence, sub-agent roster (Goldberry, Treebeard, Radagast), shared file manifest, edge cases, and rollback guidance
- **Bombadil** (Tolkien) as 8th lead agent — Tom Bombadil, the Forge Keeper. Ancient, joyful, sings while he works. Tends the forge itself while others forge applications.
- **Goldberry** added to Tolkien character pool — River-daughter, upstream change detection
- ADR-008 (scaffold branch as update source for /void)

### Changed
- **Command count** updated from 7 to 8 across CLAUDE.md, README, and Holocron
- **`.claude/settings.json` excluded from Bombadil's sync scope** — user permissions and hooks are never overwritten (Picard's architecture review finding)
- **Semver comparison** in `/void` uses integer parsing, not string comparison — prevents incorrect results for versions like 3.10.x vs 3.9.x (Picard's architecture review finding)

---

## [3.1.0] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- **PRD-driven EC2 instance type selection** — PRD frontmatter `instance_type` field recommends t3.micro/small/medium/large based on project scope (database, cache, workers, payments, framework). Haku wizard shows the recommendation with cost estimates and allows override. RDS and ElastiCache sizes match automatically. (ADR-005)
- **Cloudflare DNS wiring** — new `hostname` field in Gandalf wizard and PRD frontmatter. After Haku provisions infrastructure, it auto-creates Cloudflare DNS records (A for VPS, CNAME for platforms) pointing your domain at the provisioned resource. Works with all deploy targets. Non-fatal — infrastructure still succeeds if DNS fails. (ADR-006)
- **Platform custom domain registration** — Haku now registers your hostname directly with Vercel, Railway, and Cloudflare Pages via their APIs, so the platform expects traffic on your domain
- **Caddyfile auto-HTTPS** — when hostname is set, generated Caddyfile uses the domain instead of `:80`, enabling automatic Let's Encrypt SSL via Caddy
- **Instance sizing module** (`wizard/lib/instance-sizing.ts`) — scoring heuristic with `recommendInstanceType()`, RDS/ElastiCache size mapping, swap scaling
- **DNS module** (`wizard/lib/dns/`) — Cloudflare zone lookup, record CRUD, post-provision orchestration, cleanup support
- ADRs 005 (instance type selection), 006 (DNS as post-provision step), 007 (hostname vs domain naming)

### Changed
- **Provision script swap size** scales with instance type (2GB for micro/small, 1GB for medium, none for large)
- **Cloudflare help text** updated to recommend Zone:DNS:Edit token permission for DNS wiring
- **Architecture doc** updated with DNS in system diagram and new ADR references

---

## [3.0.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- **The VoidForge Holocron** (`HOLOCRON.md`) — comprehensive 9-chapter user guide covering setup, first project walkthrough, build protocol, agent system, slash commands, code patterns, build journal, troubleshooting, and evolution. Named after the Star Wars knowledge devices.
- **Three-tier distribution** — VoidForge now ships on three branches: `main` (full wizard), `scaffold` (methodology only), `core` (ultra-light drop-in). Each has its own README, release, and install path.
- **Branch sync rules** in CLAUDE.md — shared methodology files (agents, methods, patterns, commands) must propagate across all three branches.

### Changed
- **README restructured** — stripped down to pure system reference (architecture, components, tables). All walkthrough and guide content moved to the Holocron.
- **Semver rules updated** — MAJOR now includes distribution model changes.
- **VoidForge is now designed for external adoption** — three install paths, comprehensive guide, clean separation between system reference and user guide.

---

## [2.8.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- **Wizard split into Gandalf (setup) and Haku (deploy)** — `npx voidforge init` launches the setup wizard, `npx voidforge deploy` launches the deploy wizard. Provisioning moved from Gandalf to Haku for cleaner separation of concerns.
- **Architecture docs** — `ARCHITECTURE.md` (system overview + diagram), `SCALING.md` (three-tier assessment), `TECH_DEBT.md` (prioritized catalog), `FAILURE_MODES.md` (component failure analysis with recovery procedures)
- **Security checklist** — `SECURITY_CHECKLIST.md`, reusable pre-deploy verification list covering secrets, vault, server, AWS provisioning, generated infrastructure, input validation, and dependencies

### Changed
- **Gandalf UI simplified** — removed provisioning steps (now in Haku). Gandalf focuses on vault, credentials, project setup, PRD, and scaffold creation.

### Fixed
- **QA fixes** for Gandalf/Haku restructure
- **UX polish** for Haku deploy wizard

### Security
- **DB/Redis security group ports** restricted from `0.0.0.0/0` (internet-open) to self-referencing security group (SG-only). Prevents database and Redis exposure to the internet.
- **Security headers** added to local server: `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `Content-Security-Policy`, `Referrer-Policy`, `Permissions-Policy`
- **Error message sanitization** — API error responses no longer leak internal details (file paths, stack traces). Real errors logged server-side only.

---

## [2.7.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- **Real API provisioning** for all deploy targets — Vercel creates projects, Railway creates projects with database/Redis services, Cloudflare creates Pages projects with D1 databases, Static S3 creates buckets with website hosting. All verified with live infrastructure.
- **Shared HTTP client** for provisioner API calls with safe JSON parsing and slug generation
- **Crash recovery cleanup** — orphaned resources from process crashes can now be cleaned up after server restart via disk-persisted manifests
- **SSE keepalive** on provisioning and PRD generation streams — prevents proxy/VPN/browser timeouts with 15-second heartbeats and event IDs
- **VoidForge favicon** — purple void portal icon

### Changed
- **Generated deploy scripts** use release-directory strategy with atomic symlink swap, post-deploy health check, and automatic rollback on failure. Keeps last 5 releases.
- **Generated provision scripts** include fail2ban, SSH hardening (no root/password), unattended security updates, 2GB swap, and log rotation
- **Generated Caddyfile** includes HSTS, Content-Security-Policy, and Permissions-Policy headers
- **Generated Dockerfiles** include HEALTHCHECK instructions. Build errors no longer silenced.
- **Generated docker-compose** uses env var DB passwords (not hardcoded), internal-only ports for DB/Redis, and app health checks
- **Generated PM2 config** includes crash-loop protection and graceful reload timeouts
- **Done page** shows target-specific deploy commands, human-readable labels, clickable URLs, and free tier/cost info
- **Railway** terminology updated from "plugins" to "services"

### Fixed
- Safe JSON parsing on all external API responses — no more crashes on HTML error pages
- S3 cleanup paginates object listing — handles buckets with more than 1000 objects
- Slugify strips leading/trailing hyphens and provides fallback for empty slugs
- Cloudflare D1 database only created for SQLite projects, not Postgres
- Railway token validation works with API tokens (not just user sessions)
- Help button now expands provider accordion when collapsed
- Vercel and Cloudflare 409 (project exists) paths track resources for cleanup

### Security
- Generated Caddyfile: HSTS, CSP, Permissions-Policy headers
- Generated provision.sh: fail2ban, SSH hardening, firewall lock-down-first
- Generated docker-compose: DB passwords from environment variables, database/Redis ports internal-only
- All 4 ADRs now implemented: provision manifest, atomic vault writes, API response validation, SSE keepalive

---

## [2.6.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- **Auto-provisioning system** — wizard steps 8 + 9. After project creation, provision infrastructure for your chosen deploy target with live SSE-streamed progress.
- **Docker provisioner** — generates Dockerfile (multi-stage per framework), docker-compose.yml (with optional Postgres/MySQL/Redis services), and .dockerignore
- **AWS VPS provisioner** — full EC2 + security group + SSH key pair provisioning, with optional RDS (Postgres/MySQL) and ElastiCache (Redis). Generates deploy scripts (provision.sh, deploy.sh, rollback.sh), Caddyfile, and PM2 ecosystem config.
- **Config-only provisioners** — Vercel (vercel.json), Railway (railway.toml), Cloudflare (wrangler.toml), Static S3 (deploy-s3.sh)
- **Provisioning API** — `POST /api/provision/start` (SSE-streamed), `POST /api/provision/cleanup`, `GET /api/provision/incomplete` for crash recovery
- **Provision manifest** (ADR-001) — write-ahead resource tracking at `~/.voidforge/runs/` prevents orphaned AWS resources on crash
- **Pre-provisioning confirmation gate** — users see what will be created (and AWS cost warning) before clicking "Start Provisioning"
- **4 Architecture Decision Records** — provision manifest, atomic vault writes, API response validation, SSE keepalive
- **QA regression checklist** — 24-item checklist covering all provisioning flows, a11y, and mobile

### Changed
- **Vault writes are now atomic** (ADR-002) — write-to-temp + fsync + rename prevents credential loss on crash
- **Wizard expanded to 9 steps** — step 8 (provision with confirmation gate) and step 9 (done with infra details)
- **User-controlled transitions** — replaced auto-advance with explicit "Continue" button for a11y
- **Advanced setup card** — updated copy from "Infrastructure provisioning in future phases" to "Automatic infrastructure provisioning"

### Fixed
- **JS injection** in PM2 config via project names containing quotes — now uses `JSON.stringify`
- **S3 deploy script** — added missing `--exclude '*'` before `--include` flags
- **RDS/EC2 networking** — RDS instance now shares security group with EC2; DB/Redis ports added to SG
- **RDS password** — generated with `crypto.randomBytes` instead of predictable slug-based derivation
- **Skip provisioning** — now aborts in-flight fetch via AbortController
- **Cleanup race condition** — resources tracked per run ID instead of global mutable state
- **Security group cleanup** — retry loop with 10s intervals instead of insufficient 5s sleep
- **Empty SSH key** — validates AWS returns key material before writing file
- **Rollback script** — framework-aware restart commands (Django/Rails) instead of hardcoded npm/PM2

### Security
- **Atomic vault writes** prevent credential file corruption
- **DB password masked** on wizard done page (shown as bullet characters)
- **`.ssh/` added to .gitignore** — prevents accidental deploy key commits

---

## [2.5.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- **`/git` slash command** (`.claude/commands/git.md`) — Coulson's version & release management. 7-step flow: orient, analyze diffs, determine semver bump, write changelog, craft commit, verify consistency, optional push. 5 Marvel sub-agents (Vision, Friday, Wong, Rogers, Barton).
- **Release Manager protocol** (`docs/methods/RELEASE_MANAGER.md`) — Coulson's method doc with semver rules, changelog writing guidelines, commit message format, and verification checklist. Works for VoidForge and generic projects.
- **Coulson** (Marvel) as 7th lead agent — S.H.I.E.L.D.'s meticulous record-keeper for version management
- **Friday** added to Marvel character pool in NAMING_REGISTRY.md — AI assistant for versioning and automation

### Changed
- **CLAUDE.md** — added `/git` to Slash Commands table, Coulson to The Team table, Release Manager to Docs Reference
- **README.md** — added `/git` to commands table, Coulson to leads table, updated command count to 7, added git.md and RELEASE_MANAGER.md to repo structure
- **NAMING_REGISTRY.md** — added Coulson as Marvel lead (release), Friday to Marvel pool, updated rules and reserved list

---

## [2.4.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- **Cloud provider management** — new credential validation and storage for AWS, Vercel, Railway, and Cloudflare. Live API validation (STS, GraphQL, token verify) with vault-encrypted storage.
- **Deploy target selection** in wizard — choose deployment platform based on which providers have valid credentials. Docker always available.
- **Deploy target in `.env`** — scaffolded projects include `DEPLOY_TARGET` when a platform is selected

### Changed
- **Wizard UI overhaul** — redesigned credential step with provider cards, inline help, validation feedback. Expanded wizard flow with cloud and deploy target integration.
- **Vault concurrency** — all vault operations now serialized through a write queue to prevent race conditions on concurrent requests
- **Async key derivation** — PBKDF2 moved from sync to async to avoid blocking the event loop during encryption/decryption

### Fixed
- **Command injection** in browser launcher — replaced `exec` with `execFile` to prevent shell interpretation of URLs
- **Directory traversal** in static file server — replaced naive `..` stripping with `resolve()` + prefix check
- **SSE crash on client disconnect** — PRD generation stream now safely no-ops when the client has disconnected
- **CORS wildcard** — scoped `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` to the wizard's actual origin instead of `*`
- **Error detail leaking** — API error responses no longer include internal error bodies or stack traces
- **Password length cap** — vault unlock rejects passwords over 256 characters (DoS prevention)

### Removed
- **`claude` dependency** — removed unused package from dependencies

---

## [2.3.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- **Interactive setup wizard** (`wizard/`) — browser-based onboarding launched via `npm run wizard`. 5-step flow: credential vault, project setup, PRD creation, review, create.
- **Encrypted credential vault** (`wizard/lib/vault.ts`) — AES-256-GCM with PBKDF2 key derivation, stored at `~/.voidforge/vault.enc`. Cross-platform (macOS, Linux, Windows). Users manage the password however they like.
- **PRD generation with Claude** — streams a full PRD from a product idea using the best available model (auto-resolved via `/v1/models` API). Primary path in the wizard.
- **Bring Your Own PRD** tab — copy the generator prompt to clipboard for use with any AI (ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.), paste the result back with frontmatter validation.
- **Project scaffolding** — TypeScript port of `new-project.sh` logic with git init, CLAUDE.md substitution, .env generation.
- **CLI entry point** (`scripts/voidforge.ts`) — `npx voidforge init` launches the wizard.
- **Dynamic model resolution** (`wizard/lib/anthropic.ts`) — fetches available models from Anthropic API, picks newest Opus > Sonnet > Haiku. No hardcoded model IDs.
- **Frontmatter parser** (`wizard/lib/frontmatter.ts`) — YAML frontmatter extraction and validation for PRD documents.
- `tsconfig.json`, TypeScript and tsx dev dependencies.

### Changed
- **README.md** — wizard is now the primary Quick Start path. Manual setup is an alternative section. Repository structure updated to include `wizard/` and `scripts/voidforge.ts`.
- **`new-project.sh`** — comment noting `wizard/` exclusion from project copies.
- **`package.json`** — added `bin` field, `wizard` and `typecheck` scripts, `type: "module"`.

---

## [2.2.0] - 2026-03-12

### Changed
- **Project renamed to VoidForge** — "from nothing, everything." Replaced all references to `claude-scaffold` across README, scripts, package files, patterns, and version docs

---

## [2.1.1] - 2026-03-12

### Fixed
- **PostToolUse hook format** in `.claude/settings.json` — migrated from flat `command` field to nested `hooks` array structure per current Claude Code schema

---

## [2.1.0] - 2026-03-10

### Added
- **Build Journal system** (`docs/methods/BUILD_JOURNAL.md`) — persistent logging protocol for decisions, phase state, handoffs, errors. Every agent produces structured output in `/logs/`. Agents read journal files to recover state across sessions.
- **Context Window Management** (`docs/methods/CONTEXT_MANAGEMENT.md`) — session scoping guide, load-on-demand protocol, file size discipline, context checkpointing, emergency recovery.
- **Job queue pattern** (`docs/patterns/job-queue.ts`) — background jobs with idempotency keys, exponential backoff retry, dead letter queue, graceful shutdown. Includes BullMQ, Celery (Django), and Sidekiq (Rails) implementations.

- **Error handling pattern** (`docs/patterns/error-handling.ts`) — canonical error strategy: custom error types, global handler, response shape, operational vs programmer errors. Includes Express, Django, and Rails implementations.
- **Regression checklist template** in QA_ENGINEER.md — concrete table format with example entries, growth rules (2-3 items per feature, by launch: 30-50 items)
- **First-deploy pre-flight checklist** in `/devops` command — env vars, secrets, DB seeding, DNS, SSL, health check, rollback test, monitoring, security review
- **Phase rollback strategy** in BUILD_PROTOCOL.md and TROUBLESHOOTING.md — identify, revert, verify, isolate, fix, re-apply, log
- **Test execution timeline** in BUILD_PROTOCOL.md — authoritative table of which tests are written in which phase, all marked as breaking gates
- **Frontmatter validation table** in BUILD_PROTOCOL.md — valid values for each PRD field, defaults when missing
- **Parallel phase marking** in BUILD_PROTOCOL.md — each phase marked as parallelizable or strictly sequential
