## API Behavior

### Kongo API covers all VoidForge integration needs without custom endpoints
The PRD assumed 6 new Kongo endpoints were needed (from-prd, bulk variants, batch-status, bandit lifecycle, growth-signal, 4 webhook events). None were needed. Existing endpoints handle everything: `POST /engine/pages` with `brief` field replaces from-prd, `POST /campaigns/:id/variants/generate` replaces bulk variants, campaign analytics + client-side z-test replaces growth-signal. Only `page.completed` and `page.failed` webhooks exist.

- **category:** api-behavior
- **verified:** 2026-04-01
- **scope:** wizard/lib/kongo/ (entire integration)
- **evidence:** Read actual API docs at kongo.io/docs/api. Compared against PRD-kongo-integration.md Section 6 endpoint table. All 6 "TO BUILD" endpoints had existing alternatives.
- **context:** User owns Kongo — API is malleable if custom endpoints are ever needed. But the current surface is sufficient for the full seed-to-conversion closed loop.

### Kongo uses API keys, not OAuth
Keys use `ke_live_` prefix, created at kongo.io/dashboard/api. No OAuth provider exists. API key management endpoints (`/api-keys`) require session auth (dashboard login), not API key auth. Webhook signing secrets are shown once at key creation and cannot be retrieved again.

- **category:** api-behavior
- **verified:** 2026-04-01
- **scope:** wizard/lib/kongo/provisioner.ts
- **evidence:** Read Kongo API docs "API Key Management" and "Authentication" sections. Confirmed `ke_live_` prefix in all example requests.
- **context:** PRD originally specified OAuth provisioning (ADR-036). Changed to manual API key entry during build. Provisioner validates prefix, verifies connection, stores in financial vault.

## Root Causes

### Directory-tree walkers must define a sentinel boundary (e.g., $HOME) to prevent silent past-root directory creation
`findProjectRoot()` in `packages/voidforge/wizard/lib/marker.ts` walked up the directory tree looking for a `.voidforge` marker but had no boundary check. On non-VoidForge projects, the walk reached `~/` and silently created 45 methodology files in `$HOME`, overwriting `~/CLAUDE.md` and personal config. Root cause: missing isFile guard (`.voidforge` file vs `.voidforge/` state dir per ADR-060) and no $HOME sentinel to stop the walk.

- **category:** root-cause
- **verified:** 2026-05-11
- **scope:** `packages/voidforge/wizard/lib/marker.ts` — findProjectRoot
- **evidence:** Field report #331; user ran `npx voidforge-build update` outside a project. Fix added isFile check + $HOME boundary check. ADR-063 codified this for all future directory walkers. FORGE_KEEPER Rule #11 documents the pattern.
- **context:** Any code that walks up a directory tree to find a project root must define a sentinel boundary (typically `$HOME` or `/`). Silent walk-past is destructive. Pair with ADR-063.

### Statistical code passes tests but is mathematically wrong when tests validate buggy behavior
The growth signal z-test shipped with 3 Critical bugs: (1) control = worst variant instead of first by creation order, (2) normalCdf used as confidence instead of computing 1-pValue, (3) poll timeout 120s for 2-10 min generation. All tests passed because they asserted the buggy output. Only adversarial Gauntlet agents (Stark/Spock) caught the issues by reasoning about the math, not running tests.

- **category:** root-cause
- **verified:** 2026-04-01
- **scope:** wizard/lib/kongo/analytics.ts — computeGrowthSignal, twoProportionZTest
- **evidence:** Gauntlet R1 findings CODE-R1-001, CODE-R1-002, ARCH-R1-016. Fixed in commit dd00790.
- **context:** Statistical code needs review by an agent that understands the math, not just code quality. Tests are necessary but insufficient — a test that asserts `expect(brokenResult).toBe(brokenResult)` passes perfectly.

### Destructive git operations on multi-branch repos require branch verification
The v20.2 scaffold cleanup was correct in analysis (274 files should not be on scaffold) but wrong in execution — `git rm -r wizard/` ran on main instead of scaffold. No step verified `git branch --show-current` before deleting. The error went undetected for 10+ commits because subsequent work (/void, /debrief --inbox, /review) is methodology-only and never imports wizard modules. Caught only when the user asked to modify wizard/lib/kongo/seed.ts. Required full 272-file restoration from origin/main.

- **category:** root-cause
- **verified:** 2026-04-03
- **scope:** Multi-branch repos (main/scaffold/core) where branch-specific cleanup is needed
- **evidence:** Commit 33109f6 (scaffold cleanup on main), commit c88d532 (restoration). 10 commits between error and detection.
- **context:** Always run `git branch --show-current` before any destructive git operation. In multi-branch workflows, the working branch may not be the intended target. This is the git equivalent of "Verify Before Transact" for financial operations.

## Tooling Gotchas

### LRN-1: Claude Code caches agent definitions at session start
The Agent tool resolves `.claude/agents/*.md` frontmatter (including the `name:` field) once at session boot and does not re-read mid-session. A rename committed during a session will fail to dispatch under the new name — the tool returns `Agent type 'WandaSeldon' not found. Available agents: ...Wanda Seldon` even though disk shows `name: WandaSeldon`. Rename validation must happen in a fresh session before the rename is declared shipped.

- **category:** tooling-gotcha
- **verified:** 2026-04-20
- **scope:** `.claude/agents/*.md` frontmatter changes, especially `name:` renames
- **evidence:** WandaSeldon rename attempt mid-session; Agent tool rejected dispatch with cached-name error despite on-disk frontmatter already updated. Field report #306.
- **context:** Any rename touching the `name:` field requires a fresh-session validation step before merge/release. Related: ADR-055.

### LRN-5: `stat -f %m` is not portable between BSD/macOS and GNU/Linux
On BSD/macOS `stat -f %m FILE` returns the file's mtime in epoch seconds. On GNU/Linux `stat -f` means `--file-system` and `%m` means mount point — so the command succeeds silently with wrong output, and any `||` fallback to `stat -c %Y` never fires because exit status is 0. Use `date -r FILE +%s` for portable mtime-read in shell scripts.

- **category:** tooling-gotcha
- **verified:** 2026-04-20
- **scope:** `scripts/surfer-gate/check.sh` and any shell script needing mtime
- **evidence:** Field report #308; latent since v23.8.18, surfaced when CI `npm test` moved to root and exercised the Linux path.
- **context:** Surfer-gate state timeout checks require mtime comparison; the silent-success failure mode defeated the intended `||` portability fallback.

### LRN-8: CI workspace-scoped test invocation bypasses root pretest hooks
CI running `npm run test -w @voidforge/cli` skips the root `pretest` hook. Root-level validators (agent-ref checker, gate tests, consistency checks) are silently ignored. If the monorepo has a root `pretest`, CI MUST invoke `npm test` at repo root to exercise it.

- **category:** tooling-gotcha
- **verified:** 2026-04-20
- **scope:** `.github/workflows/*.yml` in monorepos with root pretest hooks
- **evidence:** Field report #308; `stat -f %m` non-portability (LRN-5) was masked for releases because CI used workspace-scoped test invocation.
- **context:** The workspace form is a legitimate npm feature; combining it with root pretests hides bugs. Pair LRN-5 and LRN-8 — one created the bug, the other concealed it.

## Bash Patterns

### LRN-2: Shell-escape fixes at the destination corrupt legitimate input
A `tr -d '\\'` added to strip a default-sentinel artifact in `record-roster.sh` also stripped legitimate JSON escapes (`\u0041`, `\"`, `\n`) from orchestrator-supplied roster input. The regression chain spanned v23.8.16 → v23.8.17. The correct fix is at the SOURCE of the artifact — the default construction — not at the DESTINATION as a post-hoc strip on all input. Prefer `printf '%s'` with a literal default over any construct that produces characters you then have to remove.

- **category:** bash-pattern-antipattern
- **verified:** 2026-04-20
- **scope:** `scripts/surfer-gate/record-roster.sh` and any shell helper that sanitizes stdin/args
- **evidence:** v23.8.16 introduced `tr -d '\\'`; v23.8.17 rolled forward with JSON input corruption reported by orchestrator. Root cause traced to post-hoc stripping rather than fixing the default producer.
- **context:** When you catch yourself writing a sanitizer at the destination, walk back to the source that created the artifact and fix it there. Destination-side strips are a class of bug that silently mutate valid input.

## Docs Maintenance

### LRN-3: Sibling docs drift after ADR schema changes
ADR-056 amended the Gate event schema, but the old field name `roster_json` persisted in sibling docs for 3 releases while the code emitted `roster` / `roster_text` / `roster_parsed`. The ghost field also lived at `BUILD_JOURNAL.md:46`. "Reconciled" means re-reading the ADR end-to-end and `grep -rn '<old_field>' docs/` across the entire docs tree — not patching individual sentences that look wrong.

- **category:** docs-maintenance
- **verified:** 2026-04-20
- **scope:** Entire `docs/` tree after any ADR schema amendment; common drift sites: `BUILD_JOURNAL.md`, `HOLOCRON.md`, `CLAUDE.md`
- **evidence:** ADR-056 `roster_json` ghost persisted 3 releases; code shipped `roster` / `roster_text` / `roster_parsed`. Ghost also present at `BUILD_JOURNAL.md:46`.
- **context:** Every ADR schema amendment requires a repo-wide grep for the old field name(s) as part of the reconciliation step. No reconciliation claim is valid without that grep being clean.

### LRN-10: Marketing-site scalar counts drift silently from scaffold truth
Scalar counts on sibling repos (`totalADRs`, `totalMethodDocs`, `totalScaffoldTests`, agent counts) drift silently from the scaffold. The `/void` sync touches methodology files but not the marketing site's TypeScript data constants. Either auto-sync via a CI-produced `stats.json` artifact consumed at site build time, or document the manual sync as a release task.

- **category:** docs-maintenance
- **verified:** 2026-04-20
- **scope:** Any sibling repo that imports counts from VoidForge methodology
- **evidence:** Field report #308; site was 12 ADRs + 9 versions behind at audit time. A 3-agent audit caught it.
- **context:** The sync protocol should make scalar parity mechanical, not manual. See also `docs/methods/SPEC_HANDOFF.md` for the cross-session offload pattern used in the v23.9.x audit.

## Distribution Gotchas

### LRN-4: Published npm package name must match install instructions
`package.json` declared `thevoidforge` / `thevoidforge-methodology` (published to npm since v21.0) while docs canonicalized `voidforge` / `@voidforge/methodology`. `npx voidforge init` resolved to a squatted `voidforge@0.0.1` or ENOTFOUND for 23 consecutive releases. `require.resolve('@voidforge/methodology/package.json')` was silently broken in every production install during that window.

- **category:** distribution-gotcha
- **verified:** 2026-04-20
- **scope:** `package.json` (both `packages/voidforge/` and `packages/methodology/`) vs. every doc that includes an install command
- **evidence:** Gauntlet 41 surfaced the drift. Docs said `npx voidforge init`; published manifests said `thevoidforge`. Resolved in ADR-061 / v23.9.0.
- **context:** Keep ONE canonical install command location (CLAUDE.md Distribution section) and link everywhere else — do not copy install commands across 20+ docs. Every name change in docs requires `package.json` diff verification before `npm publish`. Related: ADR-061.

### LRN-6: `npm ci` / `npm install` with existing lockfile skips cross-OS optional deps
Both `npm ci` and `npm install` with an existing lockfile fail to install platform-specific optional dependencies (e.g. `@rollup/rollup-linux-x64-gnu`) when the lockfile was generated on a different OS. Documented npm bug #4828. CI workflows must `rm -f package-lock.json && npm install` if the committed lockfile came from a different OS than the CI runner.

- **category:** distribution-gotcha
- **verified:** 2026-04-20
- **scope:** `.github/workflows/publish.yml`, any cross-platform CI reading a committed lockfile
- **evidence:** v23.9.2 publish workflow failed with missing Linux rollup binary; macOS-authored lockfile did not resolve the Linux optional dependency.
- **context:** The fix in v23.9.2 removes `package-lock.json` before `npm install` on CI. Don't rely on `npm ci` to paper over this — the bug is upstream.

### LRN-7: npm scope registry-availability does not imply org-create availability
`@voidforge/*` namespace was empty on the npm registry, but the `npm create-org` web UI rejected "voidforge" as an org name (squatter-adjacent / reserved). There is no `npm org create` CLI — scope creation is web-UI-only. Verify BOTH registry query AND the create-org form before canonicalizing a scoped name.

- **category:** distribution-gotcha
- **verified:** 2026-04-20
- **scope:** Any ADR proposing a scoped npm package
- **evidence:** Field report #308; v23.9.0 → v23.9.1 pivot from `@voidforge/cli` to unscoped `voidforge-build` after web-UI rejection.
- **context:** Companion to LRN-4. Registry probe and org-create probe are different checks — do both before committing to a name.

## Decisions

<!-- "We chose X over Y because Z" — prevents re-evaluation -->

## Environment Quirks

<!-- Platform, hosting, tooling behaviors specific to this project -->

## Vendor

<!-- Third-party service behaviors, gotchas, workarounds -->

## Workflow

<!-- Process discoveries, agent coordination patterns, build order dependencies -->

### LRN-9: Cross-session spec-doc handoff works reliably
Cross-session spec-doc handoff works reliably: Session A produces a numbered spec with file:line citations and phases; Session B executes with a copy-pasteable prompt referencing the spec. 23/26 items executed without supervision in the v23.9.x marketing-site pass. Use when the executor session is in a different repo, or when preserving the orchestrator's context budget matters.

- **category:** workflow
- **verified:** 2026-04-20
- **scope:** Multi-repo or multi-session campaigns
- **evidence:** Field report #308; SITE_UPDATE_SPEC.md executed across 5 phases, 23/26 items without back-and-forth.
- **context:** See `docs/methods/SPEC_HANDOFF.md` for the formalized pattern. Executor may optimize for literal compliance over holistic UX — orchestrator must run a review pass on the output.
