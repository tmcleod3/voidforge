# VoidForge — Failure Mode Analysis

**Version:** 2.7.0
**Last reviewed:** 2026-03-12

## Summary

| Component | Worst Case | Mitigated? | Gap |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----|
| Vault | Corrupted file, all creds lost | Yes (atomic writes) | No automatic backup |
| AWS provisioning | Orphaned resources, user billed | Yes (manifest + cleanup) | — |
| Anthropic API | Truncated PRD accepted as complete | No | Need incomplete detection |
| Project creation | Partial scaffold left on disk | No | Need cleanup on failure |
| Network | All external calls fail | Yes (timeouts + clear errors) | — |

## Detailed Analysis

### Vault File

| Scenario | What Happens | Mitigation |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| Corruption mid-write | Atomic write prevents (temp → fsync → rename) | ADR-002 |
| Deleted by user | Treated as fresh vault; re-enter all credentials | By design |
| Wrong password | GCM auth tag fails decryption; returns "wrong password" | Crypto guarantee |
| Process crash during read | No side effects (read-only) | Safe |
| Disk full during write | Temp file fails; original vault untouched | Atomic pattern |

### AWS Provisioning

| Scenario | What Happens | Mitigation |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| Process crash mid-provision | Manifest on disk lists created resources | ADR-001 |
| API error after partial creation | Resources tracked up to failure; cleanup available | Manifest + cleanup endpoint |
| Client disconnects mid-stream | Server continues to completion; manifest updated | Crash recovery on next startup |
| Cleanup fails (API error) | Error returned to user; manifest preserved for retry | Manual retry or AWS console |
| Security group delete before instances | Retry loop with 10s intervals (SG dependency) | Implemented |

### Anthropic API (PRD Generation)

| Scenario | What Happens | Mitigation |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| Invalid API key | 401 returned, clear error message | Key validation on storage |
| Timeout (>120s) | Error shown to user | Configurable timeout |
| Stream truncated (network loss) | **Gap:** Partial PRD accepted without warning | Need incomplete detection |
| API rate limited | Error shown with API message | User retries |
| Model unavailable | Fallback to known-good model ID | Dynamic model resolution |

### Project Creation

| Scenario | What Happens | Mitigation |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| Directory already exists (non-empty) | Validation rejects before creation | Pre-check |
| Disk full mid-copy | **Gap:** Partial directory left behind | Need cleanup |
| Permission denied | Error returned to user | Standard OS error |
| Git init fails | Warning logged; project created without git | Best-effort git |

### Network / External APIs

| Scenario | What Happens | Mitigation |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| No internet | All external calls fail with timeout | 10-15s timeouts, clear messages |
| Slow connection | SSE keepalive prevents proxy timeout | ADR-004 (15s heartbeat) |
| API changed response format | safeJsonParse + optional chaining | ADR-003 |
| Corporate proxy blocks SSE | Keepalive comment prevents idle timeout | ADR-004 |

### Server

| Scenario | What Happens | Mitigation |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| Port 3141 in use | Clear error message, suggests VOIDFORGE_PORT env var | Implemented |
| Unhandled route error | Try/catch returns 500 with error message | Top-level handler |
| Unhandled server error | Logged, 500 returned if headers not sent | Process-level handler |
| SIGINT/SIGTERM | Graceful shutdown with 2s timeout | Signal handlers |

## Recovery Procedures

### Orphaned AWS Resources

```bash
# Start VoidForge, check for incomplete runs
npx voidforge deploy
# Haku will show orphaned runs on step 1

# Or via API
curl http://localhost:3141/api/provision/incomplete
curl -X POST http://localhost:3141/api/provision/cleanup -d '{"runId":"<id>"}'
```

### Lost Vault Password

No recovery mechanism. User must:
1. Delete `~/.voidforge/vault.enc`
2. Re-enter all credentials through the wizard

### Corrupt Vault File

GCM auth tag will detect corruption. Same recovery as lost password.
