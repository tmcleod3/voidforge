# VoidForge — Node.js Compatibility

**Version:** 7.7.0
**Engines:** `>=20.0.0 <25.0.0`

## Tested Versions

| Node.js | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| 20.x LTS | Supported | Minimum version |
| 22.x LTS | Supported | Recommended |
| 24.x | Supported (with caveats) | node-pty required v1.2.0-beta.12+ |
| 25.x | Untested | Update engines field when node-pty ships support |

## Known ABI-Breaking Changes

### Node.js v24 — node-pty ABI Break (v7.2→v7.3)

**Date:** 2026-03-16
**Impact:** Terminal sessions fail with "posix_spawnp failed" or "Session ended" immediately.
**Root cause:** `node-pty@1.1.0` prebuilt binary was incompatible with Node.js v24's native addon ABI.
**Fix:** Upgraded to `node-pty@1.2.0-beta.12` which ships prebuilt binaries for Node v24.
**Time to fix:** 8 commits, multiple hours of debugging. The Gauntlet (static analysis) passed 6/6 — this was invisible to code review.

### Node.js v24 — Custom WebSocket Handshake (v7.2→v7.3)

**Date:** 2026-03-16
**Impact:** WebSocket connections never established; `ws.onopen` never fired.
**Root cause:** Custom RFC 6455 handshake implementation was correct per spec but incompatible with Node v24's HTTP upgrade internals.
**Fix:** Replaced 200 lines of custom WebSocket code with `ws` library (2-line import).
**Lesson:** Never implement standard protocols manually. Use established libraries.

### Node.js v24 — IPv6 Resolution (v7.3)

**Date:** 2026-03-16
**Impact:** WebSocket still failing after ws migration.
**Root cause:** Server bound to `127.0.0.1` only; macOS resolves `localhost` to `::1` (IPv6) first.
**Fix:** Changed server bind from `127.0.0.1` to `::` (dual-stack).

## Engines Field Policy

The `engines` field in `package.json` defines the supported Node.js range:

```json
"engines": {
  "node": ">=20.0.0 <25.0.0"
}
```

**When to update:**
1. When node-pty and ws both ship prebuilt binaries for a new Node.js major version
2. Test: run `npx voidforge init`, open Avengers Tower, verify terminal works
3. Update the upper bound to include the new version
4. Update this document with the test results

**When NOT to update:**
- Don't bump the lower bound without a compelling reason (breaks existing installs)
- Don't include a Node.js version you haven't tested with PTY sessions
